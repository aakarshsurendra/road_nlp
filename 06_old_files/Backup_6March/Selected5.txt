NEW DELHI: A day after a 69-year-old man died and his 5-year-old granddaughter sustained injuries in a road accident in Dwarka, it has come to light that their scooter was hit by a speeding Mercedes-Benz car. While a case of negligence has been registered against the errant driver, no arrest has been made so far. The incident took place near Sector 17 on Wednesday afternoon when Arun Kumar, a resident of Dwarka Mor, was going to drop her granddaughter off at her residence in Sector 12 after picking her up from a nursery school. CCTV footage showed Kumar riding the scooter around 1pm when a speeding black Mercedes-Benz car jumped the traffic signal , hit their vehicle from behind and fled the scene. Kumar's son-in-law Prashant Goswami revealed that the road accident victim, a former SBI manager, sustained nine fractures due to the collision- five on chest and four on back. The child suffered a fracture on her orbital bone and multiple facial injuries. "The driver didn't even pause for a second, instead accelerated and fled away. The bystanders then rushed my daughter and father-in-law to the hospital and informed us about the crash," recalled Goswami. Police said a case under sections of 279 (rash driving), 337( hurt) and 304A (death due to negligence) of the IPC had been registered at Dwarka North police station. "I've been tirelessly searching for the right medical care for my child, hopping between hospitals. This incident has left our family shattered. My daughter's closest companion was her maternal grandfather. Even during her treatment, she keeps asking about her grandfather. We don't know how to break the news to her," said the grieving son-in-law. Police further added that technical and manual surveillance had been mounted and all possible efforts were being made to identify the offending vehicle driver and nab him. Goswami said that Kumar had also made plans for a trip with his wife. "We are concerned how our daughter and mother will cope with the tragedy. It's not about the car or the road. Driving an expensive car doesn't give anyone the right to disregard others on the road. A single mistake behind the wheel can have devastating consequences for an entire family," he added.
