- DistilBert
- Binary Classification , Binary Cross - Entropy loss
- Sigmoid Activation Function
- Bias detection - NER
- Bias Recognition Module - Tokenizer -> Transformer -> Bias Entity Recognition
- NER model has been used to find if there are more female names tagged as non-person than male names
- Another NER model has identified biases based on occupation, race, and demographics
- RoBERTa, spaCy English Transformer NER Pipeline
