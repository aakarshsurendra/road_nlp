Sharma, who was found sitting on the pavement, insisted on not informing his parents about the accident, citing their fragile health due to chronic heart disease. Despite Kumar's attempts to persuade Sharma to seek medical help, he adamantly refused. Kumar arranged for the damaged car to be towed for repairs and dropped Sharma home. Later that night, Sharma complained of uneasiness and dizziness, prompting a visit to a local doctor who prescribed medication, providing temporary relief.

Late on Wednesday night, the police claimed to have arrested the two men and recovered the vehicle, a Swift Dzire. The stretch where the incident took place is close to Terminal 3 of IGI airport. Several vehicles were passing by during the incident. A video of the man being dragged by the cab - which belonged to the victim - surfaced on social media on Wednesday morning, leading to widespread outrage. It has been shot by the occupants of another vehicle which was chasing the car. The victim was identified as Bijender Shah, who lived with his family in Surya Colony in Faridabad. He had bought the car in March with a loan. Police have invoked murder charges against the accused, said DCP (southwest) Manoj C.

They boarded the cab at Saket, posing as passengers, and attacked Shah near Delhi Cantonment. Shocking: Viral video shows car dragging body of a man in Delhi, body found near NH8 He seems to have put up a stiff resistance, which eventually led to his death. The police had received a PCR call about the incident at 11.20 pm. The caller informed them that a body with injuries was lying near a service road of NH-8. When a team reached the spot, they found the victim's clothes were torn and there were serious injuries on his head and hands and a lot of blood. The victim's PAN card was found on the spot which helped the cops get in touch with his family. The video shot by the occupants of another vehicle shows that the man was trapped at the gate of the driver's seat and was dragged. The two men who recorded the clip were heard saying that the man being dragged was a driver and that he was dead. They were continuously honking to alert the driver of the car, perhaps unaware that these were criminals. The carjackers ended the chase by suddenly applying the brakes because of which the body got detached from the car. During their inquiry, the police figured out that it was a case of carjacking and could imagine the scenario of the killers dragging the victim along when he resisted and refused to let go. The cabbie was robbed at gunpoint as well. ""After studying the footage from CCTV cameras along the way, we found that the accused had taken the car to Meerut,"" said a source. ""Shah would usually leave home around 2 pm and return in the morning, between 3am and 4 am,"" a family member said.

The mishap occurred near Hansot village during the afternoon hours, police said. In the ill-fated vehicle, six people were traveling from Bharuch to Surat. Inspector Karansinh Chudasama of Hansot police station said that the toddler, though injured, managed to survive the impact with minor wounds. The other car's driver also suffered injuries due to the accident. Among the casualties were four women, including an elderly couple named Imtiyaz Patel and Salmaben, their married daughters Maria and Afifa, and Jamila Patel, the wife of Imtiyaz Patel's brother. These unfortunate souls, all residents of Bharuch, were en route to Surat when the tragedy unfolded. The young boy, who happened to be the son of Maria Patel, displayed an extraordinary stroke of luck by surviving the collision. He was promptly admitted to a nearby medical facility under the care of local law enforcement. Upon receiving notification of the accident, the police swiftly arrived at the scene. The investigation carried out by Chudasama unveiled that Imtiyaz Patel, aged in his late 50s, had been driving the vehicle and was wearing his seatbelt at the time of impact. The circumstances leading to the collision involved Patel's car attempting to overtake another vehicle while traversing a straight section of road near Hansot. Regrettably, control was lost, causing the car to veer into the opposing lane where a car driven by Hitendrasinh was traveling. Despite both cars being equipped with functional airbags, the devastating impact claimed the lives of five family members from the Patel family.

Ponda deputy SP Ashish Shirodkar told the people that it was Paresh Sawardekar who was driving the car, and not his wife Meghana. ""However, since the people were not ready to listen, I have assured them that I will bring the car owner Meghana to the police station by Wednesday noon,"" Shirodkar, who took a volley of questions from the public, which included activists, politicians, and others, told TOI. Cumbharjua MLA Rajesh Faldessai said that police told him that they would arrest the woman by Wednesday. ""We have given them time till tomorrow to arrest the woman,"" said Faldessai, a BJP MLA who alleged that the police are ""hand in glove with the accused"". Faldessai, North Goa zilla panchayat chairperson Siddesh Naik, as well as functionaries of other political parties, along with the public, questioned police as to how Paresh Sawardekar and his wife Meghana exchanged seats when the right-side door of their car was damaged. Public: Woman was unable to stand, how could she move to another seat? Police told us that the woman exchanged seats. We will not keep quiet until the victims get justice,” Faldessai said. He also assured the people that the culprit in the case will be punished. Outside the police station, the people shouted, “We want justice”. Mardol police is investigating the case. “The woman in the driver’s seat should be arrested and needs to be investigated,” said Naik, who is the son of North Goa MP and Union minister of state for tourism, Shripad Naik. “We have put this demand on behalf of the people of Divar and the people of Goa.” The Phadte couple who were killed in the acci dent were from Divar. One of the group’s leaders, activist Rama Kankonkar, said that even 50 hours after the accident, when they asked police if the woman’s medical examination was done, they said that she had left the spot. “When an accident takes place... the airbags open. The woman was not able to stand, how could she (move to) another seat?” Kankonkar also said that police said that Sawardekar was traced at Marcel, where they picked him up. “All the people gathered at the police station got a clear message from the cops that the case has been filed to compromise,” said Kankonkar, who added that the police told them that they have checked the CCTV footage from Khandepar to Banastarim, and it was found that the SUV was driven by Paresh. “We need to start our own investigation by checking the CCTV footage,” Kankonkar said, adding that “police asked us to get eyewitness”. “When there was a woman and a man inside the car, why didn't the police arrest the woman,” he asked. Kankonkar said that when both persons in the car were under the influence of alcohol, police should have conducted their medical examination, but they only did so for the man, and kept the woman safe. “Yesterday, all day, when we asked the police where the woman was, they said they were not aware,” said Kankonkar. “It has now become well known that the woman is a relative of a politician, and we think that the police are working to safeguard her.” Kankonkar also said that when he asked police whether the woman’s phone was traced, police had no answer. “If they want to safeguard the people, they will come to know who called whom,” he said.

The 46-year-old man regained consciousness after a few moments of the accident, only to find his wife lying dead on the other side of the bypass. Jyoshna Vaghule was among the 23 people who lost their lives in accidents this year on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, which has, over the years, obtained the “killer bypass” tag. After every accident, particularly the major ones, the authorities swing into action to make people aware of the risks involved with dangerous driving and policymakers return to the drawing board making long-term infrastructure development plans. The accident that killed Jyoshna had occurred when the couple were returning home around 10.30pm on a bike. Two container trucks were following on both ends of the road when one of the heavy vehicles overtook the bike. “Everything after that was a blur. The container truck was speeding and trailing my bike at a close distance. While overtaking, the truck hit me in my right leg and arm. I lost balance and the bike overturned. My wife too fell to her side and the truck hit her head, arms and the wheels went over her torso. She died on the spot,” Vaghule said. “If you ask me if I want revenge against the truck driver who had run over my wife, my answer is ‘no’. The truck driver might be the sole breadwinner of his family. I want him to repent and learn from the mistake,” he said. The couple’s children — — a 20-year-old son and a 16-year-old daughter — were on another motorcycle and trailing their parents. “They stood at the Vadgaon bridge for long pleading for help. No one was around. Finally, a man in a car took us to a nearby hospital where my wife was declared dead,” said Vaghule. Jyoshna was one of the breadwinners for her family and the sole support system for her parents. The accident has left both the families shattered. The couple’s children were in college. Jyoshna earned a living by performing chores for families in the neighbourhood and tailoring jobs, while Vaghule was a trade officer in a firm. “I lost my will to live and motivation to work. I could not work properly and lost my job. Without Jyoshna or me earning, my children had to stop going to college,” said Vaghule, who now runs a vegetable stall. His son takes up a few jobs to help his father. But Jyoshna’s parents have no one to support them. Most of the major accidents on the bypass have occurred involving overspeeding trucks and two-wheelers in rear-end collisions. While the heavy vehicle drivers contribute to the accident majorly, local traffic plays a significant role as well. In another accident caused by a motorcyclist riding on the wrong-side near Navale bridge near the bypass, a 27-year-old man, Madan Bahiparya, died due to fatal injuries to his head. He was admitted to a local hospital after the accident by some local residents. However, his brother, Ram Bahiparya, had no information. The Bahiparyas were originally from Nepal and settled in Pune for business purposes. On October 2, Madan was walking to a marble factory near the bridge where he worked when the motorcycle knocked him down. “He has left behind his wife and three children, all aged below six. There is no source of income for them anymore. His wife will be forced to farm and do some odd jobs for a living,” he said.

Luckily, all the occupants of the car survived. According to police, the car was carrying people, who were returning from a marriage ceremony around 12.15 am. The vehicle was on the north-bound flank and moving towards Beliaghata. “The car suddenly hit the median divider near the slight left curve between the canal and Chingrighata flyover. The vehicle overturned immediately and went over and fell on the southern flank,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar police. “The road bends to the left here. But the car continued straight going through the railings. The accident might have happened due to speeding or a mechanical fault. The fact that the driver had dozed off or was under the influence of alcohol cannot be entirely ruled out. However, it is likely that Bidhannagar police will hold a mechanical test of the vehicle to ascertain the exact cause of the accident,” claimed an officer from Beliaghata traffic guard. Both Kolkata Police and Bidhannagar Police officers — along with locals — rushed to the spot where they rescued all occupants. “The driver was bleeding profusely but refused to get admitted. Others carried minor injuries,” recalled Pintu Mondal, a local resident. “It is a miracle that none died in the accident,” claimed Sanjay Das , another local, residing in the Sukantanagar area.

Highway security police (HSP) SP Yeshwant Solankhe said the two vehicles entered the Samruddhi Expressway from Jalna. “Villagers spotted some passengers fleeing the SUV,” said Solankhe, adding the group’s involvement in diesel theft cannot be ruled out. “After entering the expressway at Jalna, the car travelled almost 100km before the accident,” he said.

He had fallen behind my car and had head and eye injuries,"" Yadav said. A crowd soon gathered. Some came to help, some to stare. Among them was Singh, who quickly called the PCR van. Another bystander volunteered to take the injured biker to the hospital in his car. Singh, along with others, assisted the man into the car. After that, Yadav and Singh stood by the roadside, waiting for the PCR van to arrive at the scene. For as brief as a second, Singh took a step towards his standing two-wheeler to take a look at it. At that moment, a speeding truck came from behind him and pulverised Singh. It flung him on to the road. ""The man first came under the front wheels, then the rear wheels,"" Yadav said. Those were Singh's final minutes. The truck speeded up and fled the spot. ""I shouted for the driver to stop but he sped away. My friend made a video of the truck, noting down its registration number."" Yadav said he got into his car and chased the truck for 15-20 minutes. ""At one point I overtook the water truck, but the driver took a back turn and fled,"" he said. On November 20, Yadav finally went to the police and registered a complaint against the truck. M Harshvardhan, deputy commissioner of police, Dwarka, said the truck driver, who the police identified as Bachchan Sahani of Ajaur in Begusarai, Bihar, was arrested on Tuesday. Singh, the police said, was a resident of Qutub Vihar. On the night of November 13, when the PCR van reached the accident site at 10.20, ""the victim of the first accident had been taken to hospital"". However, minutes after the first accident, a second one, this time fatal, had occurred. ""The police mounted a technical surveillance. The driver was tracked down,"" a police source said. A case was registered for causing death due to negligence and rash driving under the IPC against the truck driver Bachchan Sahani.

The car went up in flames after its CNG cylinder exploded under the impact of the crash, killing all three occupants in their 30s. The fourth victim was the driver of the pickup van into which the tanker collided. Police said three engineers of JSG InnoTech Pvt Ltd in Sonipat were on their way to distribute Diwali gifts among the private company's vendors when the accident occurred near Triveni Hotel. They were identified as Jitendra Singh from Panipat, Lokesh Saini of Jind and Pawan Dubey, who was from Bihar. According to cops, the tanker was at such speed that the driver failed to control the vehicle even after it jumped the divider and crashed into the car. The truck did not stop and rammed into the van that was on the service road. The front portion of the tanker - which was on its way to Delhi - got stuck in the bonnet of the van, whose driver, Trilok Sharma, died on the spot. The truck driver fled, leaving the vehicle behind. Sandeep Singh, Jitendra's brother who lodged a police complaint, said he had met the three engineers around 9pm at Rajiv Chowk.

Police said the accidents occurred between 4.30am and 6am - when it was still dark - near Khor village in Nuh. After one of the trucks broke down on the speedway, its owner sent another vehicle to transfer containers of ghee that the first one was carrying. The drivers were engaged in transferring the consignment when a third truck coming from the Tauru side crashed into the two vehicles from behind and plunged 20ft from the elevated expressway. All four died in the first accident itself. Around an hour later, a truck driver passing by on the other carriageway had his eyes fixated on the mangled vehicles and police's rescue operation when he rammed into another lorry from behind. Both trucks fell 20ft through the gap between the two carriageways. Three persons, police said, suffered grievous injuries and are undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital. Ashok Kumar, the owner of the truck (HR47E-7518) that broke down around 4.30am, said his driver, Prem Singh, called him up and requested for a replacement vehicle. Kumar then asked his cousin, Uday, to visit the spot with another truck. Uday reached Khor village in about half an hour with a second truck (HR55AN-3156), which was being driven by Mahendra. Uday, Prem and Mahendra were inspecting the breakdown and transferring the cargo when a third truck (HR14CE-9992) crashed into it. The three died on the spot and the driver of the third truck, Sunil Kumar, succumbed to injuries in hospital after his vehicle toppled over and fell off the expressway. Passerby informed police about the accident and a team of highway patrol reached the spot. They were retrieving the bodies from under the trucks and clearing the snarl that the accident caused when the second crash occurred on the other carriageway around 6am. The drivers of the two trucks that plunged through the gap in the carriageways and a helper are undergoing treatment at Nalhar medical college, police said. Following a complaint by Kumar, the transporter, a case was registered against Sunil for rash driving and causing death by negligence at Rozka Meo police station of Nuh. Malkhan Singh, the station house officer of Rozka Meo police station, said a team was rushed to the accident spot around 5am along with two cranes. ""The injured persons were rushed to a hospital. It took some time to bring the bodies out from under the vehicles. They were sent for autopsy. In the meantime, the cranes were deployed to remove the trucks and clear out the expressway to avoid a major snarl,"" he added. According to a survey conducted by the Haryana State Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) last year, most fatal accidents on expressways involve trucks parked along the roadside. Drivers participating in the survey admitted that since they were deprived of sleep, they tend to catch a quick nap after stopping their vehicles off roads and highways to break the monotonous run. The volume of traffic on the 135km-long KMP expressway - a peripheral road to Delhi passing through five districts of Haryana - has almost doubled over the past year to record around 65,000 vehicles a day. But KMP, which has 120kmph as the maximum speed, has also emerged as a major accident zone. Around 8-10 fatal crashes take place on the expressway every month. Since the accidents mostly involve heavy commercial vehicles and light cars driven at high speed, the survival rate is low. All 10 toll plazas on the KMP have ambulances and cranes, but government hospitals are at a considerable distance, one of the reasons that delays timely medical aid. Although speeding has emerged as the major cause of accidents, there is hardly any mechanism to check that on the expressway at the moment.

Police earlier believed Aadhi Sekhar, a Class X student, had died in an accident after he was hit by a car. The police got suspicious after they collected the CCTV footage in which it appears that the car driven by Priyaranjan, a relative of the boy, had deliberately run over him. The police conducted the investigation based on the complaint filed by the deceased boy’s parents. According to police, Priyaranjan from Nalanchira is currently absconding. As per the initial report, the child was crushed to death by a speeding car on August 30. But further investigation into the complaint by the boy's family confirmed that Priyaranjan, who was behind the wheels, deliberately mowed down the boy. Following this, police have registered a case of homicide. From the CCTV footage, Priyaranjan's car can be seen running over the boy who was riding a bicycle. Before the accident the car was seen parked by the road hinting that the driver was waiting for someone.

They told TOI on Thursday that Neha (22) was riding pillion and her grandfather Chandra Bhan (60) was driving the scooter on Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) when the car suddenly appeared in front of them. Bhan had to slam the brakes, resulting in the scooter skidding. It threw both the riders onto the road, and in the path of the truck that ran over them. Neha, a Gurugram University student, died on the spot, and her grandfather was injured. “A car was approaching from the wrong side and by the time the elderly man noticed it, it was too late. He pulled the brakes and the truck rammed into their scooter,” said Veeru Vatsalya, who has been running a tea stall on the road side for the past four years. The truck driver, booked for death by negligence and rash driving among other sections, fled from the spot. He is absconding. When asked, investigating officer Narender Kumar said cops will look into all angles.“We are yet to talk to the eyewitnesses in detail about the accident. The truck driver is still at large,” he said. Last year, traffic police and district officials had listed Vatika Chowk among the 36 accident-prone blackspots, based on an assessment of fatal crashes in areas in Gurgaon. Locals say wrong-side driving is common near the busy intersection that connects SPR and the Sohna Elevated Road (NH-248A). The crash that claimed Neha’s life took place around 400 meters ahead of the Vatika Square on SPR as the pair was going home to Palra village. Both the riders were wearing helmets. Currently, commuters on SPR going towards Badshapur have to take a U-turn that is around 200 metres from Vatika Chowk. This usually translates to a total distance of around 2.4 kilometres. Many commuters, locals allege, drive on the wrong side of the road to get to the intersection and cut their travel time by 10-15 minutes. Traffic cops are actively working to check those violating traffic rules, IO Narender Kumar added. There have been similar accidents in the city in recent months. On October 30 last year, a speeding car driven on the wrong side of Sohna Road hit a two-wheeler, killing an 18-year-old college student. A 40-year-old domestic help riding a bicycle was killed when a car, allegedly being driven beyond the speed limit and on the wrong side of the road, lost balance and rammed another car before hitting the cyclist near Vatika Chowk on October 22.

Goa police said the vehicle was travelling at such a high speed that when it slammed into the tree, a male passenger was flung out and landed on his head several metres away from the vehicle. The car was being driven by Shawn Fernandes , 26, who died in the accident along with his cousin sister, Abigail D’Souza, 21, and brother-in-law Veldrofe D’Souza, 26. Fiona D’Souza , 22, has suffered serious head injuries and is “battling for life”, while Ninoshka Fernandes, 21, has multiple fractures but is stable, police said. Both are undergoing treatment at GMC. “Prima facie, it appears that the vehicle was overspeeding and while trying to overtake a jeep, the vehicle’s driver lost control. It doesn’t look like alcohol was involved though we cannot say so conclusively,” North Goa SP Nidhin Valsan told TOI. “It seems like Shawn had been working through the day and had only come to pick up the others. He was tired and it appears that he failed to assess the situation correctly,” Valsan said. “Tyre skid marks begin 30 metres before the accident site, and veer from the left side of the road to the right and towards the tree.” Police said the accident occurred on the Panaji-Mapusa highway at around 1.20am, when the car on its way to Parra banged into the tree in front of a stationery store at Porvorim just after Delfino’s supermarket. “The car had five passengers, including the driver. Two of the occupants of the car had gone to Quepem for a birthday party. Shawn had picked them up to bring them to his house at Canca Parra for a celebration,” Porvorim PI Anant Gaonkar said. Shawn’s social media feeds show that he loved cooking and was preparing stuffed chicken and chorizo along with Ninoshka merely hours before his death. Police said it appeared from the fishing rods found near the car that the cousins had planned to go angling on Sunday morning. The postmortem examination of the deceased is yet to be carried out, Valsan said. The high-speed collision stripped the bark of the tree and tore away the rear door of the car. The man who was thrust out of the car appears to have fallen in the middle of the road. Abigail was an Anjuna resident and Veldrofe lived at Badem. Of the survivors, Fiona is a resident of Merces and Ninoshka resides at Anjuna. The accident brings back memories of the horrific Banastarim crash nearly a month ago on August 6, when a drunk driver Paresh Sawardekar in a Mercedes-Benz SUV killed three persons and injured many others, some of whom are still bedridden.

Police said the car - a Mahindra TUV - was headed for Rajasthan's Sikar when it crashed into the bus near Crossings Republik around 6am. CCTV footage circulated on social media showed the bus trying to swerve to the right to avoid a collision but ending up crashing into the TUV because the car, too, had steered to its left. TimesView Like speeding, wrong side driving can have disastrous consequences, as exemplified in this case. Those brazenly flouting the rule of the road should receive summary and exemplary punishment. But a long-term solution to the problem lies only in putting an accurate and smart electronic system in place which will ensure that thousands of traffic rule violators — accident or no accident — don’t get away. That will be the best deterrent. The tragic incident also underlines the importance of driving cautiously and being alert all the time on highways. No stopping bus that drove 8km on wrong side The bus (U-CT 7835), being driven on the wrong lane of Delhi-Meerut Expressway, that crashed into an SUV on Tuesday morning, had earlier ferried students of Vishwa Bharti School in Noida but was now attached with a private firm, Orient Fashions. The bus, which still had a sticker of the school pasted on it, is owned by P S Choudhury Tours and Travels, police said. Police identified the dead - all travelling in a Mahindra TUV - as Narendra Yadav (45), who ran an electronics shop in Meerut, his wife Anita, sister-in-law Babita (38), sons Himanshu (12) and Deepanshu (15) and niece Vanshika (7). Narendra's brother, Dharmendra (42), and nephew, Kartik (8), are being treated at a private hospital. The accident triggered questions on the lack of enforcement by traffic cops and patrolling teams of the NHAI on DME. Additional DCP (traffic) Ramanand Kushwaha said the bus driver, Prempal (38) from Aligarh, told police that he filled CNG at a station in Ghazipur. He was going to Nand Nagri in Delhi to pick up employees of the private company, but took a wrong turn. Prempal got on to the DME and kept driving on the wrong side for around 8km until he crashed into the SUV cruising at almost 100kmph. CCTV footage shows the bus entering the DME at Khoda where vehicles are supposed to exit the expressway. ""Such was the impact that the front portion of the car was totally mangled. We had to cut open the windows to get the occupants out. They were taken to SJM Hospital in Noida, where six were declared dead on arrival. Two are undergoing treatment in the emergency ward,"" Kushwaha said. A doctor said Dharmendra and Kartik are in ICU. ""They have grievous injuries in the head and abdomen. The next 48 hours are crucial,"" the doctor said. Sanjay Yadav, Narendra's cousin in Meerut, said the family was headed for a puja at a temple in Sikar. ""The bus travelled for 8km on the wrong side where vehicles zoom at 100kmph. What were the cops doing? There was no NHAI team. What was the fault of my family?"" he asked. A police probe showed the bus had a history of traffic violations. Between 2015 and 2023, it was challaned for Rs 14,000. A complaint was lodged at Wave City police station by Narendra's brother Jitendra. The driver was arrested.

The driver picked up the children at Chithamangalam and was going along the Chennai-Trichy national highway to their school when a car hit the auto from behind. The vehicle fell into a roadside pit and the 10 children and the driver suffered injuries and were rushed to the nearest government hospital in ambulances. While the children were discharged after treatment, the driver, who suffered grievous injuries, was referred to Chengalpet Government Medical College Hospital for further care. The Madurantakam police, who filed a case, used CCTV cameras to identify the car involved and arrested its driver, Srinivasan, on charges of rash and negligent driving. This has reiterated the need to regulate not only buses and vans, owned by schools, but all private vehicles, including autos and minivans, used to transport schoolchildren, say experts. After the pandemic, most private schools have stopped operating their own buses or vans citing financial reasons. Apart from rising fuel and operational costs, stringent checking norms at RTOs have deterred many schools from continuing van services. This has forced parents to opt for private vans and autos. “They are not subjected to strict checks like school vans and mostly get fitness certificates renewed after paying bribes through agents. This has to change and all vehicles ferrying children should be treated the same way,” said road safety advocate R Srinivasan.

Half an hour later, when she called him again, she was told about the accident. Khan was out on Wednesday midnight to celebrate his 42nd birthday with friends. He had dinner with them and even cut a cake at midnight. TimesView Road safety measures and respect for traffic laws must be inculcated in all schoolchildren from an early age. That a minor could casually drive away with his father’s car and cause the death of someone is part of a larger societal problem. Parents need to counsel their children about the perils of underage driving and taking to the wheel without training. This accident underscores why parents must do this as soon as they bring home a vehicle. The 17-year-old boy, who was driving his father's car, came from Parel with a friend. Khan and his friend, Kiran (35), were returning around 5.30am from Marine Drive. As Khan was taking a right turn, the boy, who was coming at a high speed, applied brakes. ""Since it had rained in the night, the car skidded and it rammed the bike. The impact was so high that the victims were flung into the air and fell on the road. While Khan died on the spot, Kiran was admitted to JJ Hospital, where she died on Wednesday evening.

""We have collected his (boy's) blood samples and sent it to the Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina for examination to find out if he was drunk,"" an officer said. The police said the boy, who used to go cycling every morning, took the keys of the car while his father was asleep. He left home saying he was going cycling. He along with a friend came to Chowpatty, where the accident took place, said the police. The boy's father, a bank employee, had bought the car from another person last month and the car is yet to be transferred in his name, said an officer. ""We have submitted a report to the Child Welfare Committee,"" an officer said. The police booked the minor and his father under Section 304A (causing death by negligence), Section 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and Section 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and invoked Section 181 (driving vehicles in contravention of Section 3 or Section 4) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The police recorded the father's statement and issued him a notice. He reportedly told the police that he had undergone a bypass surgery and that is why he could not transfer the car in his name.

The accident happened around 9.30am on Sunday in front of AVL Society in Sector 36. Although the Dwarka Expressway's city section is nearly ready, it is yet to be opened to commuters. But people use the road anyway to avoid making detours when they travel between the new sectors and NH-8 and paying toll at Kherki Daula. On the same expressway lane, as a result, high speed traffic moves in both directions. Tanuj Arya, who drives a cab for a living, was returning to their home in Delhi''s Rohini from Gurgaon with his mother Monika, father Narendra and wife Shikha. They had just taken the expressway when the car on the wrong side crashed into Tanuj's Dzire. ""I could not spot the car because it came all of a sudden. The driver had not switched on the indicators either,"" Tanuj said in his complaint. Monika was in the passenger seat. She suffered injuries in the head and died during treatment at a hospital. The driver of the car on the wrong side and another person with him were injured too. An FIR was registered against the driver at Sector 37 police station under sections 279 (whoever drives any vehicle, or rides, on any public way in a manner so rash or negligent as to endanger human life, or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person), 304A (causing death by negligence), and 337 (whoever causes hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life, or the personal safety of others) of the IPC and Section 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Police said they were checking CCTV footage on the stretch. ""We haven't made any arrests yet. We are scanning CCTV footage to ascertain the sequence of events,"" said Aman, the SHO of Sector 37 police station. Residents living in societies off the expressway warned that more such accidents would happen if NHAI and the traffic police did not take corrective measures immediately to stop wrong-side driving. Three weeks ago, NHAI closed down a loop that allows people to get on to the Dwarka Expressway from NH-8. An alternative - Pataudi Road - is also closed for the past two months. ""So, the only option for people is to pass the Kherki Daula toll plaza and make a long detour. Commuters unwilling to do that resort to wrong-side driving. NHAI and the traffic police must open the loop,"" said Ivan Singh, who lives in Sector 92. ""The loop is ready, but why is NHAI not opening it? It has also not merged the Dwarka Expressway with NH-8 near Narsinghpur. Wrong-side driving is a menace there too,"" said Madan Kumar of Sector 86. NHAI officials told TOI they were trying to expedite ""the remaining work"" so that the expressway could be opened at the earliest. On Monday morning, ACP traffic (west) Akhil Kumar and other cops visited the accident spot along with road safety officers (RSOs) and issued challans to those found driving on the wrong side.

The car, a German-make compact SUV, turned into Gurusaday Road from Syed Amir Ali Avenue and was driven around 500 metres, when it spun out of control, swerved sharply to the right and hit the far kerb. A milk truck, coming from the opposite direction, barrelled into its left, making it roll over. The crash alerted several in the neighbourhood, who pulled the SUV's occupants out. The driver, front-seat occupant and a rear-seat passenger were injured, but conscious.

Another aspect which remains shrouded in mystery is how three college students knew or came to know the three other boys travelling with them. Rajesh Singh , 27) a resident of Niwaru Road, was driving the car when it crashed into a median curb on Tuesday. He died on the spot. Three girls who were travelling in the car died. They were students at a private residential university near Tonk. Cops are still perplexed about how the three students met Singh and where they were headed early Tuesday morning. “There were six persons in the car. Two survivors, Shubh and Yash, both residents of Jaipur, are battling for life. They are not in a condition to divulge any details,” said an officer. The police did not say if they had tried to speak to the university administration about what time the girls left the campus and if the authorities gave any kind of requisite permission for the same or not. “This is a case of accident, so it is not essential to the investigation where they were coming from and how they knew each other,” said an officer. While Singh’s body was handed over to the family after postmortem on Tuesday, the bodies of the three friends from a private university, identified as Dhanusha TK, 20, a native of Ernakulam in Kerala, Arya Arti, 20, a resident of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh , and Anshika Mishra , 20, a resident of Gujarat, were handed over to their families on Wednesday. Anishka’s autopsy was conducted at the Jaipuria hospital, while Arya and Dhanusha’s post-mortem was done at a private medical university near Sitapura. Arya’s uncle KK Jaiswal said, “She had been studying at the university for a long time. We are all in shock. We will return home and mull over what next step to take.” Anshika’s family and relatives said that she was planning to return home after her semester examination. “Last time when we spoke, she wanted to come to Jaipur from the campus to shop for a family function,” said her cousin. Dhanusha’s relative Sudheer said that her family members said that they did not know anything about Singh, who was driving the car, or about two other boys.

The Rathis — businessman Shiv Shankar, 54, his mother Kamala, 73, and 23-yearold-son Srivatsa, 23 – were all killed in a road accident on their way back home from the wedding when a bus-jacker hit their car while trying to escape with the vehicle with cops and bus operators in pursuit. “My sister was also travelling in the same car but other relatives insisted that she joined them in another car and said that they would drop her home. So, she shifted to another car at the last moment. Had she been there, we doubt if she could have come out of the crash alive,” said Sarala’s cousin, who was also at the wedding on Sunday. Once she was back home, she began to worry about her husband, mother-in-law and son since they were taking longer than usual to arrive and started calling them. Some calls went unanswered and then a cop took a call on Shiv Shankar’s mobile and informed her about the accident while asking her to reach RG Kar Medical College and Hospital at the earliest. “She called us in a panicstricken voice around 4 am and asked us to rush to the hospital. She called other family members as well, including her daughter and all of us reached the hospital only to find all of them dead. On the happiest day of their lives, the family has been left completely devastated,” said Deepak Daga, a relative. The newly wed daughter, Ayushi, a doctor with a private hospital off EM Bypass, rushed to the hospital in her wedding attire along with her husband Devendra Gupta. She was initially not told about the deaths but upon learning, she fainted. So did Sarala, as relatives took both of them back to their Maniktala home. “The two have been shellshocked and are losing consciousness every now and then. It has been such a shocking incident that none of us have words to console the two,” said Rajkumar Baheti, another relative. The Rathis ran a family business of electrical goods and have a shop named Shiva Electricals near Poddar Court in central Kolkata. The car too was registered in the company’s name and carried a doctor’s sticker as Ayushi used to drive the same to and from hospital mostly. Srivatsa was pursuing MBA and was helping his father in the business. Kamala was a homemaker and her husband Tara Chand had died around 10 years ago. “Shiv Shankar was a great man.

The teenager from Bally in Howrah, who was driving his father’s car without a licence, was booked under IPC sections 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 279 (rash and negligent driving), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 427 (mischief). He will be tried before a juvenile court on Monday. Three of his friends who were in the car with him were handed over to their parents and were let go. The accident happened around 5.15am on the airport-bound flank of the New Town main arterial road at Owl More when the biker, a mini truck, a motorised van and another car had stopped before a red signal. Witnesses said, the young man at the wheels of the SUV was driving at breakneck speed trying to catch up with two other cars slightly ahead of him. While the two cars stopped at the signal, the young man failed to control the vehicle and swerved left, first hitting the biker before ramming into other vehicles. The impact left the front portion of the SUV damaged and the motorbike completely crushed.

Had we known we would have certainly stopped him from heading out and driving,” said the father before a relative whisked him inside the police station telling him not to speak to reporters.

The front of the car was completely mangled and the body of driver Hiralal Jaiswara (46) crushed between the steering wheel and seat. The two back-seat occupants, cousins Kundan and Rajesh Mullick, both in their late 20s, were sandwiched between the collapsed seats and had to be brought out along with the car seat. They are fighting for life at RG Kar Hospital and Medical College. None of the occupants in the car wore seatbelts and the twin front airbags did not deploy.

Upon searching for the vehicle owner with RTO records, the Pali police detected that it’s an SUV (Scorpio) registered in the name of an agro-infra company in which MLC Aniket Tatkare is a director. The police are inquiring as to why the accused car driver had put up a fake number plate at the time of the accident. The motorcycle was heading towards Khopoli from Pali. Rider Hemraj Patil (40), who works as a caretaker of a farmhouse, and his wife Meenabai are residents of Pali taluka. The couple was travelling towards Khopoli while the car (i-20 Asta) was plying in the opposite direction. Accused driver Pravin Salunke is a resident of Pali taluka. He drove the car on the wrong side and dashed the motorcycle at Chive village area. While Hemraj was killed on the spot, Meenabai sustained injuries and has been admitted to MGM hospital, Kamothe. As per the sources the accused drove on the wrong side to avoid heavy water flowing from a nearby township onto the main road. The car damaged a signboard of the township. Salunke was rushed to a local hospital with chest pain, and blood pressure, and was later shifted to a hospital in Lonavala. The SUV (MH 06 BV 7786) is registered in the name of Multiventure Agro Infrastructure private limited wherein MLC Aniket Tatkare is a director. This has raised suspicion among locals on police investigation that too without invoking any section on using fake number plate. Pali police inspector Sarita Chavan said, “The car records provided by the Salunke family member do not have any mention of the RTO vehicle registration number. The RTO report is awaited. The car driver has not been arrested but is hospitalised.” The accused has been booked under IPC sections for causing death by negligent driving, rash driving and causing grievous injury, and under the Motor Vehicle Act.

""We are searching for that passenger to know whether the person had witnessed the accident,"" an officer said. The accused told cops that he was going home after having dinner when he hit something. Police said, they are investigating his testimony. ""We suspect that the accused knew about the accident that's why he left his car,"" police said. DCP (southwest) Manoj C said they received a PCR call at 11.15pm on Tuesday about an accident near Gate No. 1 of IIT. The two men had been injured in the mishap. ""Khan died of his injuries during treatment at Safdarjung Hospital while Shukla, who has a fracture in his leg, is undergoing treatment at Max Hospital in Saket,"" said the DCP. Cops will send the blood sample of the accused to a forensic lab to ascertain whether he was drunk. The complainant in the case is a head constable who said that when he reached the spot, he found two shoes and broken parts of the car. About 400 metres away, he found a white Verna car parked on the footpath with a cracked windscreen and a damaged bumper. No one was inside the vehicle. A case under Sections 304 A (causing death by negligence) and 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) of the IPC was registered. Police said the two friends had gone to a restaurant in the SDA market across the road and were coming back when they were hit. The cops suspect that they may have jumped over the railings on the divider. When TOI visited the spot, it found that there is a subway right next to the gate which has a board near the entrance proclaiming that it's open from 6am to 10pm. According to residents of the area and students, this poses a serious problem. ""You have to either cross the road by jumping over the railings or have to walk to Ber Sarai or Jia Sarai down the road to cross over. The government should allow the subway to open at night and post guards for security,"" said a Ph.D student, Abhishek. Another student pointed out that some people go to the Metro station to cross the road but the station too is closed at night. A senior PWD official said people avoid taking subways even during the day. ""And at night, they are afraid of getting attacked by anti-social elements. We keep some facilities closed at night due to frequent incidents of thefts and vandalism,"" said the official. An MCD official said unless these projects are self-sustainable and remunerative, it is difficult to guard these confined spaces round the clock due to law and order problems. He pointed out that subways where shops and eateries are located are safer. Deploying guards during the night for all subways will be a costly affair when the footfall is anyway low, argue officials.

Police said the bus driver could not see the truck because of dense fog and by the time he applied the brakes, it was too late. The bus rammed into the rear of the truck, skidded off the road and fell into a ditch. Over the past two days, highways across northern India witnessed several accidents as fog reduced visibility to a few hundred metres. Twenty-two people were injured - three of them critical - in two accidents in Haryana's Jhajjhar and Noida on Monday morning. The Yamuna Expressway accident took place in Dankaur around 6.30am, when the bus carrying 60 passengers was headed for Delhi. ""Passersby called us to inform about the accident. Teams were rushed to the spot and the injured passengers were taken to nearby hospitals. The bus was travelling from Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh and was headed for Delhi,"" said Abhishek Verma, the deputy commissioner of police. ""Preliminary investigation revealed that the truck moving ahead of the bus had applied the brakes suddenly. By the time the bus driver realised this, he had crashed into the truck from behind. In an attempt to swerve to the left, the bus broke the railing of the expressway and fell into a ditch,"" he added. Of the 29 passengers who were found injured, most were taken to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Kasna in Greater Noida. Two passengers were rushed to Kailash Hospital. Guddu (26), a resident of Lalitpur in UP, was declared brought dead at GIMS . ""All the injured passengers were given emergency care and kept under observation through the day. One of them was dead by the time he was wheeled in. Five patients had factures and three with head trauma were admitted to the ICU. The others are in the general ward,"" said Dr RK Gupta, a retired brigadier and the director of GIMS. Police have detained the truck driver although a complaint is yet to be lodged in connection with the accident. As visibility was reduced, several cars were stopped at the Jewar toll plaza after the accident and asked to move only after the fog cleared out. ""We have been spreading awareness among commuters. We have also instructed the staff at the Jewar toll plaza to counsel the drivers and check the condition of their vehicles. If they think a driver is sleepy, the vehicle should be made to park at the toll plaza for some time,"" said Ganesh Saha, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic). Over the past few years, drivers falling asleep while at the wheel and overloaded heavy vehicles moving slowly on the expressway have been major reasons for accidents. In a separate accident in Dadri, a truck loaded with sacks of lentils hit a divider and overturned on Tuesday morning. There were no injuries and a traffic snarl was spared as police managed to remove the vehicle in some time.

The National Highways Authority of India on Monday said a Detailed Project Report (DPR) was being prepared for 10 ""black spots"" on the 50km Pune-Satara road to prevent accidents. These spots include the high gradient of the road near Navale bridge that causes heavy vehicles to descend at full speed, especially if the driver turns off the ignition and engages the neutral gear.

Besides, a public-address system would be used continuously to appeal to truck drivers not to drive their vehicles with the ignition off, in neutral (gear). The speed limit for heavy vehicles would be reduced to 40kmph and rumble strips would be laid on the bypass and on service lanes. No-parking and no-halting zones would be created on the stretch between New Katraj Tunnel and Navale bridge.

While police claimed that Mohammad Dilshad, a resident of Makanpur, died when he stuck his head out of a car window to spit and got hit by a truck, his family alleged he was tortured in jail and succumbed to the injuries in hospital later. Saloni Aggarwal, ACP (Kotwali), backed the police FIR saying the driver of the truck that hit Dilshad and his helper were arrested and they had confessed to the crime. Dilshad, she said, was wanted in a molestation case and two cops — inspector Vijay and constable Sandeep — were sent to his house on Monday to bring him to Vijay Nagar police station for questioning. “He was being brought to the police station in a private car. When they were on NH-9, Dilshad stuck his head out of the window and was hit by a speeding truck. The two cops took him to a nearby hospital, where he died during treatment,” the officer said. The truck driver, Hukum Singh, and helper Praveen were arrested. “An FIR was registered against them under sections 304A (death due to negligence) and 279 (rash driving) of the IPC,” she said. “Forensic experts also joined the investigation. They found traces of blood at the accident spot.” Dilshad’s family members, however, alleged that he was beaten up by cops at Abhay Khand police outpost. Dilshad ran a laundry shop in Makanpur where he would also wash police uniforms. “Around 2pm on Monday, constable Neeraj Rathi called us to the police outpost and asked us to bring the uniform of the chowki in-charge along. My brother and I went there on a bike,” said Naushad , his younger brother. While Dilshad was allowed inside the police outpost, his brother was asked to go back. “While leaving, I saw some of the cops beating my brother up. I intervened, but the cops threatened to thrash me as well. I informed my father at home and we returned to the police post with a few neighbours,” Naushad said. Dilshad’s relatives were asked to go to Vijay Nagar police station instead. From there, they were directed to Indirapuram police station. “Over the next five hours or so, we were made to run from one police station to another. But we had no clue about my brother,” he added. Around 7pm, Naushad said, police informed them that Dilshad had died in an accident and his body was lying in the morgue. “How could he die all of a sudden? How did he meet with an accident when he was taken away by the cops? Where did he die? The cops did not answer any of the questions,” he added. After Dilshad’s family lodged a complaint, an FIR was registered against constable Neeraj Rathi and other cops of Vijay Nagar police station under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC.

Several cars on the highway were reduced to heaps of metal. According to police, the injured are undergoing treatment at different hospitals. Local police said the accident took place sometime after 10.30 pm when a truck barreling through the highway began to flounder, possibly due to excessive speed and slammed into three different vehicles, including two cars. One of the cars that was hit by the truck then struck another vehicle that spun around on the highway before colliding with a rushing vehicle. As vehicles began to pile up on the highway, traffic came to a grinding halt. “It was a multiple-axle truck that had triggered the pile-up on the highway. The first car that the truck had rammed into shot off the divider and landed on a service lane. The same truck smashed into another car which got almost sandwiched between the divider and the truck,” an official said. Locals claimed they were shocking howls of cries across the highway soon after vehicles hit each other. Some dazed passengers and drivers emerged from their wrecked vehicles with their faces covered in blood and bruises all over their bodies. Till early Monday morning, police had not learned of any casualties. Officials, however, also said at least four cars were reduced to a jumble of crushed metal as they could barely be recognised. A search and rescue operation began as soon as the highway control room was informed of the incident. Ambulances were called. Policemen sifted through twisted cars to look for people who were stuck under the debris of their wrecked vehicles. “All vehicles were headed to Jaipur. Many vehicles had registration numbers of Haryana , Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Railings alongside the service lanes were completely destroyed in the accident,” the official said. A resident of Mundawar tehsil in Alwar, Dharmendra Choudhary, was one of the persons injured in the accident. He was coming back from Haryana with his wife and two kids when a vehicle hit his car. He said his daughter sustained injuries in the accident and there was complete mayhem and confusion on the highway. Behror SHO Prem Prakash told TOI that traffic was diverted from Shahjahanpur on account of the farmer protests. He said n FIR was registered in the case and police were looking for the truck driver.

While no fatalities were reported, a truck driver sustained serious injuries and nine others travelling in cars escaped with minor bruises in the crash, police said. The pile-up, however, triggered a long snarl on the Meerut to Ghaziabad carriageway and traffic movement could resume two hours later. Ghaziabad’s additional deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ramanand Kushwaha told TOI that visibility on the expressway had dipped to about 50 metres due to a thick fog cover around 8am. While vehicles were moving slowly at the time, the pile-up was triggered by a car suddenly applying the brakes. “A truck, which was just behind it, also had to stop. At that moment, a second vehicle hit the truck and passed through its left side. A third vehicle then collided with the truck and stopped there. After this, other vehicles – mostly cars, another truck, an oil tanker and a bus – collided with each other,” Kushwaha said. The truck driver, Harikesh Kumar (24), who had stepped out to check the damage to his vehicle after a car bumped it from the left, was hit by the third car. He sustained severe injuries and is undergoing treatment at a private hospital, SHO of Masuri police station Ravindra Pant said. According to a senior police officer, the NHAI’s Dausa control room immediately alerted police patrol cars and ambulances. The first ambulance reached the accident spot within 15 minutes, the officer said. Cranes, car mechanics, fire engines and a total of five ambulances were pressed into service to remove the damaged vehicles and evacuate the injured. Traffic movement on the Meerut to Ghaziabad carriageway could be resumed partially after the police lined up the damaged vehicles on one side of the road. However, all the damaged vehicles could be towed away from the carriageway by 1 pm, and traffic movement normalise another couple of hours later, police said.

Police are looking into whether the Jaguar XK — having a VIP number plate (0001) with an Odisha registration — was racing another vehicle, as an SUV had zipped past the accident site seconds earlier. The sedan, police said, was being driven by Samuel Andrew Pyster , a resident of Faridabad who works with a multinational payment card services company. He had come to Noida along with some friends to have breakfast at Starbucks, the cops said. The victim, Deepika Tripathi, was a receptionist at Raj Nandini Estates, whose office is in the E-Square building. She had left her Sector 143 home on her scooter around 9.30am to reach office by 10. Sundays aren’t necessarily off days at real estate firms, which see client visits going up during the weekends. The accident happened half an hour later, just as she was getting into the office building. “We received a PCR call about the accident and rushed a team to the spot from the Sector 39 police station. Deepika was taken to Yatharth Hospital in Sector 110. She was declared dead on arrival,” said ACP Rajneesh Verma. Pyster was taken into custody and the sedan seized. He was in the car with a friend, who took Deepika to the hospital. Ravindra Chauhan , a manager at Raj Nandini Estates and Deepika’s colleague, said a guard of the building informed him about the accident. “She was about to park her scooter when the car crashed into it. I was initially told that Deepika had been taken to Jaypee Hospital. But after reaching there, I learnt that she was at Yatharth. There, the doctors told me she could not make it to the emergency ward,” Chauhan said. Deepika, he said, had joined the company three-four months ago. One of the guards at E-Square, a witness to the accident, said the impact broke Deepika's scooter into pieces in an instant. “The car rammed the scooter so hard that Deepika was flung into the air for a few seconds and landed on the road. The scooter broke into pieces, like a toy. An SUV had crossed the area seconds earlier and the car was speeding right behind it,” said Nizamuddin, the guard. Lalit Trivedi, Deepika’s brother-in-law in Lucknow, said he received a call from police, informing him she had met with an accident. “I called up her brother and told him to check on her. I thought it was a minor accident and left for work. Later in the day, I called up her brother and was told that Deepika was no more. I rushed to Noida,” Trivedi said. Deepika’s brother Rajeev, who works as a guard at a highrise, lodged a complaint at Sector 39 police station on Sunday evening. “A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (causing death by negligence) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the IPC was registered against Pyster. He was arrested from the accident spot itself,” said Verma. “The body was handed over to the woman’s family after an autopsy. Further investigation is underway,” the ACP said.

There is no foot overbridge or subway in the area and the only way to cross the road is to dodge traffic and count on staying alive. The two fast friends were hit by an allegedly rashly driven car. Identified as Vanshika Mishra and Manvi , they lived with their families in a cluster of huts in Udyog Nagar and studied in Class IX at Sarvodya Kanya Vidyalaya in Peeragarhi Village. The car, a Swift Dzire, was driven by Arun Sharma, a resident of Adhyapak Nagar in Nangloi. He was caught by a bystander and handed over to police.

The complainant in this case, one Ravi Saxena, had come to a car showroom when he saw the silver-coloured car being driven in a zigzag manner and hitting the two girls at 3.45 pm. ""One of the girls was hit by the side of the car, the other was hit from the front and she fell on the car's windshield,"" the complainant told the police.

The family members of the girls said they were informed about the incident by a person who was crossing the road. Manvi's mother, Rita Chauhan, said they used to tell her daughter not to use the road as it is very busy and heavy vehicles move on it. ""I was worried about my daughter's safety. I always told Manvi that I would accompany her to tuition and would help her cross the road, but she would say that she will cross the road by herself,"" she said.
