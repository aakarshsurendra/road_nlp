The impact of the accident was such that all the vehicles were severely damaged. The airbags of Raunak's car had deployed,\" said police. Alerted by the sound, many gathered near the spot. As Ganatra tried to flee, the mob started beating him. A police beat marshal, Rohidas Bhawari, arrived at the spot around that time and finally Ganatra was detained. The injured were rushed to Nair hospital in a police van. \"Rai was declared brought dead, Dharmendra is undergoing treatment,\" said Rupesh Valanjoo, police sub-inspector. Complainant Manoj Rai, 35, a relative of Rai, said Anshu had been driving a taxi in the city and was coming towards him to share dinner when the incident happened. TimesView This is a serious societal problem when people have no fear of the consequences of their actions. An innocent life is snuffed out because someone decides to drive rashly under the influence of alcohol. The cops must ensure a watertight case against the drunk driver and make him face the full force of the law. Ganatra, who did his graduation in banking and insurance from a Mumbai college, was alone in the car. \"Ganatra's blood samples were collected at JJ Hospital and they will be sent for forensic examination,\" said a police officer. He has also been booked under IPC section 304II (if act is done with knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, etc), under which the maximum punishment is 10 years in prison. The police said Ganatra was returning from a restaurant in Fort. \"He drank alcohol at the restaurant. We will be collecting CCTV footage from the restaurant,\" said the officer.

      "Content: NAMAKKAL : A two-year-old boy, who was run over by a reversing car twice within a span of a few seconds, survived with grievous injuries at Pattanam near Rasipuram in the district on Saturday. The injured boy has been identified as K Dharun , son of Kannan of Pattanam village. Kannan is running a laundry shop in the village. According to the Rasipuram police, the intestine of the boy has been damaged in the accident. Bone fractures in the spinal cord and rib were also identified, police said. The accident happened when Dharun was playing on the street close to his father’s shop. A car that was reversing knocked the boy down. The boy came under the right rear wheel of the car and was run over. The car driver didn’t see the boy playing on the backside. “The driver whose identity was not known didn’t see the boy,” Rasipuram police inspector Sugavanam said. When the driver took the car towards the front, the vehicle once again ran over the boy. People who saw the accident rushed to the spot and made the driver stop the car. “Fellow villagers and Kannan rushed the toddler to a nearby private hospital from where he was referred to a private hospital in Coimbatore for further treatment,” Sugavanam said. The video of the accident went viral on social media. The Rasipuram police contacted Kannan to register a case. “But the parents were not ready to give a complaint due to which we have not registered any case,” the inspector added.

      "Content: NEW DELHI: Three occupants of an Eeco van were killed and eight others were injured after their vehicle collided head on with a DTC bus on a flyover near Loni Gol Chakkar in northeast Delhi on Thursday afternoon. Going by the account of some survivors, it appears that the driver of the Eeco swerved in order to save a biker and jumped over the divider, landing in front of the bus in the other carriageway. However, police are probing if the driver fell asleep behind the wheel. The Eeco driver, Shiv Kumar (35), was critically injured in the accident. Cops will record his statement once he recovers, they said. The incident took place around 12.30pm. The DTC bus was going from Bhajanpura to Nand Nagri while the Eeco van was travelling in the other direction. There were 11 persons in the Eeco van, which was being run as a taxi. 9-year-old among injured in collision of van & bus Passers-by alerted police, who rushed to the spot and took the victims out of the van. The passengers of the bus were found unhurt but its driver fled. The Eeco passengers were rushed to GTB Hospital where three of them were declared dead on arrival. The impact of the accident was evident from the mangled remains of the van, which was completely crushed. \"Out of the three killed, only two of them have been identified - as Savita (55) and Jitender (25). The identity of the third deceased, who seems to be in his early 30s, is yet to be established. Savita was with her daughter, Reena (42), son-in law Nand Kishore Chowdhary (45) and her grandson aged 14 in the van. Apart from this the other injured have been identified as Nitesh (25) and his two minor sisters - Neha aged 14 and Sadhna aged 9 - and another injured Manzoor Ansari,\" said Joy Tirkey , deputy commissioner of police, north-east. Cops have registered an FIR under sections of causing death due to negligence and rash driving and begun investigation. They are questioning the injured as well the passengers of the bus to ascertain the exact sequence of events. They are also collecting the footage of CCTV cameras on the way to ascertain if the Eeco driver had been speeding. The family members of Chowdhary had just returned after completing the rituals of Nand Kishore's mother's death anniversary in Bihar when they got news of his accident. Nand Kishore's son Nipunj said, \"My father, mother, brother and my grandmother had gone to Muzaffarpur, Bihar, for the first anniversary of my paternal grandmother. They all had reached Anand Vihar railway station and taken a taxi for their home in Sadatpur Extension area,\" said Nipunj. The family runs a lamination business and Nipunj was informed about the incident by police while he was at work. The cab driver's family members, who too were present at the hospital, said he has two sons who are married and he had lost his wife earlier. Kumar had been driving the cab for the last two years from Harsh Vihar to Anand Vihar. It was through Kumar's wallet that his identity was established. Sadhna who was under treatment for her injuries resides in Karawal Nagar area. She studies in class 4 at a government school and had gone to Bareilly to her aunt's house for the holidays. Since school had now reopened, she along with her cousins Nitesh and Neha had reached Delhi via train. The trio had hired the Eeco taxi for Khajuri Khas. Neha says they managed to survive as they were sitting on the rear seat. \"We don't know what happened because we could not see in the front. The car suddenly jumped and hit head on with the bus. We were later pulled out of the car and taken to hospital,\" said Neha. Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.\n",

      "Content: COIMBATORE: Two days after a 25-year-old woman was killed when her shawl got entangled in the rear wheel of the bike she was riding pillion, the city traffic police on Friday requested women to be cautious while travelling on two-wheelers. S Afrin of Kurichi in the city, an MBA student, was returning home with her friend S Sylesh, 25, after attending a farewell party in the college at Sulur on Wednesday night. When they reached Ravathur Junction on L&T Bypass, Afrin's dupatta got caught in the rear wheel of the motorcycle. She fell on the road and was dragged for a few metres. Though Afrin was rushed to a private hospital near Singanallur, she died without responding to the treatment. Many youngsters who own motorcycles, fail to fix sari guard on them, endangering lives of women who travel with them, said N Mathivanan, deputy commissioner of police. \"Women should be alert while travelling on two-wheelers and prevent shawl and sari from getting stuck in the wheel. You may have to pay a heavy price for negligence,\" he said. The officer also urged car owners to be alert and take steps to curb freak accidents. \"Last Saturday, 43-year-old A Sreepan of Gandhi Nagar, a passenger autorickshaw driver, was killed after a car rammed his auto at Athipalayam Pirivu near Ganapathy. Car driver S Charles Anthony, 52, of Sundaram Garden at Ganapathy, tried to apply the brakes, but his footwear got stuck in the accelerator. Sreepan sustained internal bleeding and passed away in a private hospital.\" Motorists should act responsibly not only to save their life, but also to save the lives of others on the street, Mathivanan added.

      "Content: GURGAON: A luxury car caught fire and was almost completely charred after hitting a tree on Golf Course Road in the early hours of Thursday. The driver fled the spot, police said. The Porsche 911, according to police, first rammed a divider in Sector 27 around 4am on Thursday, after which it crashed into a tree. The impact was such that the car immediately burst into flames. A passerby noticed the fire and called the emergency helpline. When a police team reached the spot, the car was mostly in ashes with the driver missing. A team from the fire department doused the flames. “Around 4am, I heard a loud bang. I saw a car crashing into a tree at a very high speed. By the time we could realise what had happened, it had caught fire,” said Prakash, a passerby. Police said the driver had fled the spot and so no injury has been reported thus far. As no complaint has been filed, an FIR hasn’t been registered. “A passerby informed us about the car. The Porsche was reportedly being driven at a very high speed when the driver lost control and first hit the divider on Golf Course Road. Later, the driver hit the tree. When police and fire department teams arrived, there was no trace of the driver. Also, no complaint has been registered so far. We are trying to locate the owner of the Porsche,” a senior police officer said. According to the district road safety committee, rash driving is a perennial issue in the city. In the first three months of 2023, rash driving has claimed as many as 90 lives and left over 160 injured in over 227 accidents.
