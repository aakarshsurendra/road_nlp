{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Singer Zayn Malik met with a minor accident while making his first appearance at a public event in five years at Paris Fashion Week. In a video which circulated online, following the event, the former One Direction member appeared to get his foot run over when a car went in the wrong direction toward the singer. He was seen getting shuffled through a crowd before wincing at the vehicle\'s maneuver, reports aceshowbiz.com. People around Zayn appeared to be more shocked than the star himself as many voiced their concern for him. "God damn! Oh my God!" one person was heard shouting, before the 31-year-old got into his car that whisked him away. Malik has since given an update on his condition following the minor accident. Not letting the unfortunate situation ruin his night, the \'Pillowtalk\' crooner wrote on his Instagram page later that night, "Thanks for a great show!" Sharing photos from the fashion event, the father of one also included a picture of his white sneakers, one of which appeared merely scuffed up with some dark tread marks. "My foot is fine !!" he assured his followers, before downplaying the incident as adding, "Thanks to my incredibly well made shoes." Malik has been keeping a low-profile since he got in a scuffle with his then-girlfriend Gigi\'s mother Yolanda Hadid in October 2021. He entered a no contest plea to four charges of harassment and was sentenced to 360 days of probation and completion of anger management and domestic violence education programmes.

Police said Dinesh Beniwal (37) and Ranbir Singh Chahal (40) died in an accident that happened between 11:30 pm and midnight. "They were on official work when the accident happened," a police source said. Ram Kumar, Chahal\'s relative and the complainant, said that the truck driver\'s sudden application of brakes caused the car behind it to collide with the truck. Beniwal, who had gotten a lead in a case, was driving. They were both headed somewhere when they encountered thick fog. As they descended from a flyover, they saw a truck and collided with it, Kumar said. A police source said the case for which Beniwal and Chahal were travelling was related to a robbery in the Adarsh Nagar area. A senior police officer of Kundli police station said the truck driver fled, leaving the vehicle behind. "The front portion of the car in which the officers were travelling was mangled.
