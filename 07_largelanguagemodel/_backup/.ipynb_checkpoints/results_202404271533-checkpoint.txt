{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hyderabad: A 28-year-old software engineer , who came down from Australia to Peddapalli to attend wedding of a relative, drowned when his car plunged into roadside farm well in Peddapalli town in the very early hours of Saturday. Police suspect the victim failed to negotiate a curve on the road due to speeding and the car fell deep into the well. The accident occurred at 2.30 am when Vineet Reddy along with three relatives was travelling in the car. While the three managed to get out of the sinking car, Vineet, who was at the wheel with the seat belt strap on, couldn’t free himself in time and drowned as the car sank in the agricultural well. According to Peddapalli police, his relatives, D Sai Teja Reddy, Akhil Reddy and A Rohit Reddy, escaped with minor injuries. Vineet was supposed to go back to Australia shortly as he had landed in Telangana a month ago to attend his cousin’s marriage. On Friday night, all the relatives attended a dinner at Reddy Colony in Peddapalli. Late in the night, Vineet decided to return to his house at Rangampalli in the town. “Vineet was driving the car and three cousins were with him. There was a road curve at the accident spot and perhaps due to speeding, Vineet failed to negotiate the road curve. The car went off the road, hit the protection wall of the well and crashed into it,” police said. Sai Teja immediately managed to open a door of the car and came out. As soon as the door was opened, water entered into the car and the vehicle began to submerge. The other doors got jammed. As the other three cousins started banging on the the window glasses, Sai Teja climbed out holding a pipe. Once he was out, he dropped a boulder on the rear windshield of the car, making an opening in it. Rohit and Akhil managed to sneak out through the broken windshield and climbed to safety. “Vineet wore a seat belt. It took some time for him to remove it. He also had to wait for his turn to get out of the car as Rohit and Akhil were ahead of him. By the time his turn came, the car submerged and he could not get out,” police said.
