{'role': 'user', 'content': "The roads in Europe are set to take a cue from the skies as all new cars sold in the European Union are now mandated to be equipped with sophisticated data recorders , named ‘Event Data Recorder’ (EDRs). Inspired by similar technology called “black boxes” used in airplanes, these devices promise to heighten accident investigation and road safety . But what exactly do these black boxes do, and how will they impact European drivers? Let's buckle up and explore: These black boxes, also known as Event Data Recorders (EDRs), are small devices hidden inside a car's electronics. They keep track of important information like how fast the car is going, how hard the brakes are being pressed, and even when the airbags deploy during a crash. Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Review: Angrier, faster and better | TOI Auto Usually installed in the airbag control unit, the EDR is always on and cannot be switched off. It activates automatically when the airbags or seat belt pre-tensioners are engaged. It also starts recording if the car's active hood pops out or if there's a sudden change in speed, either sideways or forwards, of more than 8 kmph within 0.15 seconds. The box, specifically, keeps a track of this data for a short time: five seconds before the crash and just 0.3 seconds after the impact. How is it useful? By pinpointing common accident factors and risky driving patterns, authorities can tailor road safety campaigns and infrastructure improvements. Furthermore, data from EDRs can help determine fault in accidents, streamlining the insurance claims process for both drivers and insurers. Do you think a similar mandate should be introduced in India as well, considering that the country often struggles with numerous accidents resulting in loss of lives every year?
