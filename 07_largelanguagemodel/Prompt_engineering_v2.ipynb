According to police, the truck loaded with cement was overtaking recklessly when it rammed into the car on the Hanumangarh-Sardarshahar highway around 10pm. The family members were returning from a birthday party and the accident occurred barely four kilometres before their home in Naurangdesar. The truck driver fled. The crash was so severe that the front portion of the car was completely mangled, and the cops had to take help from locals to extricate the victims. For Gurbachan Singh Majbi, the bedridden family patriarch who did not attend the party, the accident snatched away his wife and children, leaving only a grandson and granddaughter alive. Both kids are in hospital. \\\"The relatives of the deceased have filed a case against the truck driver,\\\" Hanumangarh circle inspector Vedpal Sheoran said on Sunday.
