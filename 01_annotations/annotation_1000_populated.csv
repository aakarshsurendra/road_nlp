Sharma, who had sustained injuries in the collision, refrained from seeking medical treatment due to his concern for his parents, both suffering from chronic heart diseases. The fear of causing shock to his parents led Sharma to keep the accident a secret, resulting in a delayed response to his critical condition. The incident unfolded when Sharma's Hyundai Verna was hit by a tractor-trolley beneath the Dwarka Expressway flyover around 9:30 pm. Despite minor bruises from the impact, Sharma's internal bleeding went unnoticed, and he started experiencing severe chest and head pain hours later as he headed home to Garhi Harsaru from Khandsa. Sharma's brother-in-law, Manish Kumar, was alerted about the accident and rushed to the scene at 10 pm. Sharma, who was found sitting on the pavement, insisted on not informing his parents about the accident, citing their fragile health due to chronic heart disease. Despite Kumar's attempts to persuade Sharma to seek medical help, he adamantly refused. Kumar arranged for the damaged car to be towed for repairs and dropped Sharma home. Later that night, Sharma complained of uneasiness and dizziness, prompting a visit to a local doctor who prescribed medication, providing temporary relief. However, Sharma's condition worsened, and he was rushed to a private hospital in Gurugram's Sector 90 after intense pain and headaches.

Late on Wednesday night, the police claimed to have arrested the two men and recovered the vehicle, a Swift Dzire. The stretch where the incident took place is close to Terminal 3 of IGI airport. Several vehicles were passing by during the incident. A video of the man being dragged by the cab - which belonged to the victim - surfaced on social media on Wednesday morning, leading to widespread outrage. It has been shot by the occupants of another vehicle which was chasing the car. The victim was identified as Bijender Shah, who lived with his family in Surya Colony in Faridabad. He had bought the car in March with a loan. Police have invoked murder charges against the accused, said DCP (southwest) Manoj C. Cab driver dumped on NH-8 in pool of blood The two men have been identified as Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Mehraj, who are residents of Meerut and have a criminal record (15 cases), cops said. They boarded the cab at Saket, posing as passengers, and attacked Shah near Delhi Cantonment. Shocking: Viral video shows car dragging body of a man in Delhi, body found near NH8 He seems to have put up a stiff resistance, which eventually led to his death. The police had received a PCR call about the incident at 11.20 pm. The caller informed them that a body with injuries was lying near a service road of NH-8. When a team reached the spot, they found the victim's clothes were torn and there were serious injuries on his head and hands and a lot of blood. The victim's PAN card was found on the spot which helped the cops get in touch with his family. The video shot by the occupants of another vehicle shows that the man was trapped at the gate of the driver's seat and was dragged. The two men who recorded the clip were heard saying that the man being dragged was a driver and that he was dead. They were continuously honking to alert the driver of the car, perhaps unaware that these were criminals. The carjackers ended the chase by suddenly applying the brakes because of which the body got detached from the car. During their inquiry, the police figured out that it was a case of carjacking and could imagine the scenario of the killers dragging the victim along when he resisted and refused to let go. The cabbie was robbed at gunpoint as well. ""After studying the footage from CCTV cameras along the way, we found that the accused had taken the car to Meerut,"" said a source. ""Shah would usually leave home around 2 pm and return in the morning, between 3am and 4 am,"" a family member said. They said Shah had called his wife at 7.30 pm and told her that he was picking up his first passenger. At 10.28 pm, his phone was switched off in the Delhi Cantt area. ""His younger brother, Ranjit, who is in Bihar, received a call from police at 1.30 am asking him to come to hospital with the photograph of Shah,"" said Rakesh, Shah's brother. Ranjit informed Shah's wife and the family started calling Shah on his phone. After one-and-a-half hours, they went to the police station.

He was promptly admitted to a nearby medical facility under the care of local law enforcement. Upon receiving notification of the accident, the police swiftly arrived at the scene. The investigation carried out by Chudasama unveiled that Imtiyaz Patel, aged in his late 50s, had been driving the vehicle and was wearing his seatbelt at the time of impact. The circumstances leading to the collision involved Patel's car attempting to overtake another vehicle while traversing a straight section of road near Hansot. Regrettably, control was lost, causing the car to veer into the opposing lane where a car driven by Hitendrasinh was traveling. Despite both cars being equipped with functional airbags, the devastating impact claimed the lives of five family members from the Patel family. In a stroke of fortune, Hitendrasinh and the young toddler emerged from the crash with their lives intact.

The woman was not able to stand, how could she (move to) another seat?” Kankonkar also said that police said that Sawardekar was traced at Marcel, where they picked him up. “All the people gathered at the police station got a clear message from the cops that the case has been filed to compromise,” said Kankonkar, who added that the police told them that they have checked the CCTV footage from Khandepar to Banastarim, and it was found that the SUV was driven by Paresh. “We need to start our own investigation by checking the CCTV footage,” Kankonkar said, adding that “police asked us to get eyewitness”. “When there was a woman and a man inside the car, why didn't the police arrest the woman,” he asked. Kankonkar said that when both persons in the car were under the influence of alcohol, police should have conducted their medical examination, but they only did so for the man, and kept the woman safe. “Yesterday, all day, when we asked the police where the woman was, they said they were not aware,” said Kankonkar. “It has now become well known that the woman is a relative of a politician, and we think that the police are working to safeguard her.” Kankonkar also said that when he asked police whether the woman’s phone was traced, police had no answer. “If they want to safeguard the people, they will come to know who called whom,” he said.

The five friends - Partha Garodia (18), siblings Anuradha and Tanoy Daga (18 & 17), Prajjal Agarwal (26) and Nihar - were headed for an eatery on Bypass, as they often did. An officer of the fatal squad of Kolkata Police that is investigating the case along with local police said, ""The car was travelling at over 90 kmph, way above the permissible 60kmph on straight stretches of Maa and 30kmph at the turns and entry and exit ramps.

The deceased — Shaik Nausheer Ahmed, a resident of Dairy Circle on Hosur Road — was an agent of a used bikes showroom in Jayanagar IV Block. Pillion rider Syed Mudasir, 27, who is into trading of stocks, is from Veerasagara in Tumakuru district. According to police, Mudasir sustained injury on his chin and minor bruises on his body. The accident happened around 9.20pm when Ahmed was riding the bike at high speed and hit the car that came in a perpendicular direction towards him from the left side. The bike crashed into the front portion of the car, police said. Citing preliminary investigation, cops said Ahmed was trying to show the speed of BMW S 1000 RR bike (registration number KA-01-HW-1272) to his customer. Both were without helmets. Police seized the bike and the Maruti Suzuki Baleno car (registration number KA-03-NM-8146). Based on a complaint filed by Ahmed’s elder brother Shaik Irshad Ahmed, a businessman, Wilson Garden traffic police registered a case against the car driver under IPC section 304A (negligence causing death). Shaik alleged the car was speeding and hit the bike. Anitha B Haddannavar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic-east), said if the deceased had worn a helmet he would have survived. He had sustained a head injury which led to his death. A senior police officer said Mudasir recently purchased a used Suzuki Hayabusa bike from Ahmed. Since he didn’t like its condition and performance, he had come to Ahmed to sell it off. Ahmed insisted that Mudasir take a look at the BMW bike and took him for a ride.

The three occupants of the car, including its driver, also suffered serious injuries in the accident. “They are undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Warje. The driver of the car has suffered fracture to his right hand,” the Warje police said. Inspector Ajay Kulkarni of the Warje police told TOI, “The workers had put an L-shaped barricade to protect themselves from vehicles at the work site. The car crashed into the L-shaped barricade and hit the two workers while they were busy painting the crash railings on the bridge. Both the workers were flung into air. They landed on the service road under the bridge after the accident and died on the spot.” Police identified the deceased as Sunny Nandlal Goud (23) and Vijay Bahadur Mataroo (28) of Chikhali. They were hired by a contractor for the painting work commissioned by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which maintains the bypass. “Both of them are natives of Uttar Pradesh. They had been staying in Chikhali for the last two to three years. The car occupants are also from Chikhali. They had gone to Satara on a visit and were returning to Chikhali when the accident took place,” the inspector said. Preliminary police investigation revealed that the driver of the car, coming from Navale bridge, lost control over the vehicle while negotiating a right turn on the approach to the accident location along the bypass. “The car crashed through the barricade and hit the workers. We suspect that instead of applying the brakes after spotting the barricades and workers, the car driver may have accidentally hit the accelerator and lost control over the vehicle,” the officer said. “We have registered a case of rash and negligent driving causing death and injury against the car driver. We have also issued a notice asking him to join our investigation as and when summoned by the police,” Kulkarni said. A senior NHAI official said, “We have a policy for compensation in cases involving such accidental deaths. The amount of compensation depends on several factors, including the age of the victim.

363,596,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/bypass-accident-victims-kin-struggle-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/105506535.cms,"Pune: Suryakanth Vaghule still shudders recalling the night of January 29 , when a speeding truck rammed his motorcycle and ran over his wife on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. The 46-year-old man regained consciousness after a few moments of the accident, only to find his wife lying dead on the other side of the bypass. Jyoshna Vaghule was among the 23 people who lost their lives in accidents this year on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, which has, over the years, obtained the “killer bypass” tag. After every accident, particularly the major ones, the authorities swing into action to make people aware of the risks involved with dangerous driving and policymakers return to the drawing board making long-term infrastructure development plans. The accident that killed Jyoshna had occurred when the couple were returning home around 10.30pm on a bike. Two container trucks were following on both ends of the road when one of the heavy vehicles overtook the bike. “Everything after that was a blur. The container truck was speeding and trailing my bike at a close distance. While overtaking, the truck hit me in my right leg and arm. I lost balance and the bike overturned. My wife too fell to her side and the truck hit her head, arms and the wheels went over her torso. She died on the spot,” Vaghule said. “If you ask me if I want revenge against the truck driver who had run over my wife, my answer is ‘no’. The truck driver might be the sole breadwinner of his family. I want him to repent and learn from the mistake,” he said. The couple’s children — — a 20-year-old son and a 16-year-old daughter — were on another motorcycle and trailing their parents. “They stood at the Vadgaon bridge for long pleading for help. No one was around. Finally, a man in a car took us to a nearby hospital where my wife was declared dead,” said Vaghule. Jyoshna was one of the breadwinners for her family and the sole support system for her parents. The accident has left both the families shattered. The couple’s children were in college. Jyoshna earned a living by performing chores for families in the neighbourhood and tailoring jobs, while Vaghule was a trade officer in a firm. “I lost my will to live and motivation to work. I could not work properly and lost my job. Without Jyoshna or me earning, my children had to stop going to college,” said Vaghule, who now runs a vegetable stall. His son takes up a few jobs to help his father. But Jyoshna’s parents have no one to support them. Most of the major accidents on the bypass have occurred involving overspeeding trucks and two-wheelers in rear-end collisions. While the heavy vehicle drivers contribute to the accident majorly, local traffic plays a significant role as well. In another accident caused by a motorcyclist riding on the wrong-side near Navale bridge near the bypass, a 27-year-old man, Madan Bahiparya, died due to fatal injuries to his head. He was admitted to a local hospital after the accident by some local residents. However, his brother, Ram Bahiparya, had no information. The Bahiparyas were originally from Nepal and settled in Pune for business purposes. On October 2, Madan was walking to a marble factory near the bridge where he worked when the motorcycle knocked him down. “He has left behind his wife and three children, all aged below six. There is no source of income for them anymore. His wife will be forced to farm and do some odd jobs for a living,” he said.

Luckily, all the occupants of the car survived. According to police, the car was carrying people, who were returning from a marriage ceremony around 12.15 am. The vehicle was on the north-bound flank and moving towards Beliaghata. “The car suddenly hit the median divider near the slight left curve between the canal and Chingrighata flyover. The vehicle overturned immediately and went over and fell on the southern flank,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar police. “The road bends to the left here. But the car continued straight going through the railings. The accident might have happened due to speeding or a mechanical fault. The fact that the driver had dozed off or was under the influence of alcohol cannot be entirely ruled out. However, it is likely that Bidhannagar police will hold a mechanical test of the vehicle to ascertain the exact cause of the accident,” claimed an officer from Beliaghata traffic guard. Both Kolkata Police and Bidhannagar Police officers — along with locals — rushed to the spot where they rescued all occupants. “The driver was bleeding profusely but refused to get admitted. Others carried minor injuries,” recalled Pintu Mondal, a local resident. “It is a miracle that none died in the accident,” claimed Sanjay Das , another local, residing in the Sukantanagar area. Bidhannagar South police later took over the probe. This was exactly the same spot where a bus had tumbled over in April under identical situation, injuring three persons. Senior Kolkata Traffic Police officers visited the spot to discuss road designing to check such accidents. “We have carried out multiple checks on ensuring safety of motorists here.

The driver of the car, Ajaykumar Bhilala, 24, managed to get out of the burning car but succumbed to the injuries at a hospital. The accident happened near Deulgaon Kol village on Dusar-Beed interchange in Buldhana district. The car hit an impact barrier on the side of the road before turning into a fireball. The identity of the two burned to death could not be confirmed till the filing of the report. Buldhana police said the three victims are likely to be from Madhya Pradesh. The Samruddhi Expressway has witnessed 39 accidents since it became operational in December last year. The car was towing an SUV. Cops said both vehicles were carrying around 20 cans of diesel. This hints at an organized diesel theft racket on the Samruddhi Expressway, said cops. The diesel was probably stolen from vehicles, especially trucks, parked on the expressway. Police said the half dozen diesel cans inside the car probably led to the fire which gutted the vehicle. Cops found 14 cans of diesel inside the SUV, which rolled for around 200m after the towing rope snapped in the accident. The passengers of the SUV fled the spot. Highway security police (HSP) SP Yeshwant Solankhe said the two vehicles entered the Samruddhi Expressway from Jalna. “Villagers spotted some passengers fleeing the SUV,” said Solankhe, adding the group’s involvement in diesel theft cannot be ruled out. “After entering the expressway at Jalna, the car travelled almost 100km before the accident,” he said. Assistant police inspector Sadanand Sonkamble of Bibi police station in Buldhana said the reason behind the accident is yet to be ascertained. “It’s not clear how and why the car veered to one side and crashed into the impact barriers,” Sonkamble said, adding the highway security police reached the spot within a short time and shifted the bodies and the injured driver to hospital. “An offence will be registered against Bhilala.

How the good Samaritan died is a nightmare that Amarjeet Yadav (32) lived to narrate. In a matter of minutes, Yadav had witnessed two accidents. He had also just met 46-year-old Singh, and then seen Yadav die under a truck. On November 13, Yadav was on his way to Gurgaon and had slowed his vehicle near Kargil Chowk in north Dwarka. As his car slowed down, a motorcyclist rammed into it from the rear. ""I got down from the car and saw the rider was drunk and had rammed into my vehicle. He had fallen behind my car and had head and eye injuries,"" Yadav said. A crowd soon gathered. Some came to help, some to stare. Among them was Singh, who quickly called the PCR van. Another bystander volunteered to take the injured biker to the hospital in his car. Singh, along with others, assisted the man into the car. After that, Yadav and Singh stood by the roadside, waiting for the PCR van to arrive at the scene. For as brief as a second, Singh took a step towards his standing two-wheeler to take a look at it. At that moment, a speeding truck came from behind him and pulverised Singh. It flung him on to the road. ""The man first came under the front wheels, then the rear wheels,"" Yadav said. Those were Singh's final minutes. The truck speeded up and fled the spot. ""I shouted for the driver to stop but he sped away. My friend made a video of the truck, noting down its registration number."" Yadav said he got into his car and chased the truck for 15-20 minutes. ""At one point I overtook the water truck, but the driver took a back turn and fled,"" he said. On November 20, Yadav finally went to the police and registered a complaint against the truck. M Harshvardhan, deputy commissioner of police, Dwarka, said the truck driver, who the police identified as Bachchan Sahani of Ajaur in Begusarai, Bihar, was arrested on Tuesday. Singh, the police said, was a resident of Qutub Vihar.

Police said the accidents occurred between 4.30am and 6am - when it was still dark - near Khor village in Nuh. After one of the trucks broke down on the speedway, its owner sent another vehicle to transfer containers of ghee that the first one was carrying. The drivers were engaged in transferring the consignment when a third truck coming from the Tauru side crashed into the two vehicles from behind and plunged 20ft from the elevated expressway. All four died in the first accident itself. Around an hour later, a truck driver passing by on the other carriageway had his eyes fixated on the mangled vehicles and police's rescue operation when he rammed into another lorry from behind. Both trucks fell 20ft through the gap between the two carriageways. Three persons, police said, suffered grievous injuries and are undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital. Ashok Kumar, the owner of the truck (HR47E-7518) that broke down around 4.30am, said his driver, Prem Singh, called him up and requested for a replacement vehicle. Kumar then asked his cousin, Uday, to visit the spot with another truck. Uday reached Khor village in about half an hour with a second truck (HR55AN-3156), which was being driven by Mahendra. Uday, Prem and Mahendra were inspecting the breakdown and transferring the cargo when a third truck (HR14CE-9992) crashed into it. The three died on the spot and the driver of the third truck, Sunil Kumar, succumbed to injuries in hospital after his vehicle toppled over and fell off the expressway. Passerby informed police about the accident and a team of highway patrol reached the spot. They were retrieving the bodies from under the trucks and clearing the snarl that the accident caused when the second crash occurred on the other carriageway around 6am. The drivers of the two trucks that plunged through the gap in the carriageways and a helper are undergoing treatment at Nalhar medical college, police said. Following a complaint by Kumar, the transporter, a case was registered against Sunil for rash driving and causing death by negligence at Rozka Meo police station of Nuh. Malkhan Singh, the station house officer of Rozka Meo police station, said a team was rushed to the accident spot around 5am along with two cranes. ""The injured persons were rushed to a hospital. It took some time to bring the bodies out from under the vehicles. They were sent for autopsy. In the meantime, the cranes were deployed to remove the trucks and clear out the expressway to avoid a major snarl,"" he added. According to a survey conducted by the Haryana State Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) last year, most fatal accidents on expressways involve trucks parked along the roadside. Drivers participating in the survey admitted that since they were deprived of sleep, they tend to catch a quick nap after stopping their vehicles off roads and highways to break the monotonous run. The volume of traffic on the 135km-long KMP expressway - a peripheral road to Delhi passing through five districts of Haryana - has almost doubled over the past year to record around 65,000 vehicles a day. But KMP, which has 120kmph as the maximum speed, has also emerged as a major accident zone. Around 8-10 fatal crashes take place on the expressway every month. Since the accidents mostly involve heavy commercial vehicles and light cars driven at high speed, the survival rate is low. All 10 toll plazas on the KMP have ambulances and cranes, but government hospitals are at a considerable distance, one of the reasons that delays timely medical aid. Although speeding has emerged as the major cause of accidents, there is hardly any mechanism to check that on the expressway at the moment.

The car, although with a private number plate, is registered with a a media house. ""We have seized the car and are questioning three persons to find out who had been driving the car at the time of the accident. One of them is a senior manager, and another one is a driver. The third person was found with the car during its seizure,"" said a senior officer of Bidhannagar City Police. Around 4.30pm on Sunday, 23-year-old Shakil Ahmed was hit by the car while he was headed to his Murshidabad home. Cops said the youth was walking past some guardrails when the car hit him and then multiple guardrails and sped away. While probing the case, the first hurdle the cops met with was lack of visuals. The cameras installed in the area turned out to be non-functional for the past one week. ""There are 70-odd cameras in the area but there is a connectivity problem due to a drainage work that involved digging up the underground cables. As a result, we had to rely on cameras outside this area for the first visuals.

Finally, a car was traced to a service centre near Ruby Hospital. ""It was the car involved in the accident. The man who had brought it was also there. He said he was only instructed by the accused to bring the car for repairs. But he was not at the wheels when the accident occurred,"" said Praveen Prakash, DC (New Town) of Bidhannagar City police. A forensic team and engineers from the service centre secured traces of the seized vehicle from the accident spot. the DC then briefed the media in front of the agitating students.

The police got suspicious after they collected the CCTV footage in which it appears that the car driven by Priyaranjan, a relative of the boy, had deliberately run over him. The police conducted the investigation based on the complaint filed by the deceased boy’s parents. According to police, Priyaranjan from Nalanchira is currently absconding. As per the initial report, the child was crushed to death by a speeding car on August 30. But further investigation into the complaint by the boy's family confirmed that Priyaranjan, who was behind the wheels, deliberately mowed down the boy. Following this, police have registered a case of homicide. From the CCTV footage, Priyaranjan's car can be seen running over the boy who was riding a bicycle.

They told TOI on Thursday that Neha (22) was riding pillion and her grandfather Chandra Bhan (60) was driving the scooter on Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) when the car suddenly appeared in front of them. Bhan had to slam the brakes, resulting in the scooter skidding. It threw both the riders onto the road, and in the path of the truck that ran over them. Neha, a Gurugram University student, died on the spot, and her grandfather was injured. “A car was approaching from the wrong side and by the time the elderly man noticed it, it was too late. He pulled the brakes and the truck rammed into their scooter,” said Veeru Vatsalya, who has been running a tea stall on the road side for the past four years. The truck driver, booked for death by negligence and rash driving among other sections, fled from the spot. He is absconding. When asked, investigating officer Narender Kumar said cops will look into all angles.“We are yet to talk to the eyewitnesses in detail about the accident. The truck driver is still at large,” he said. Last year, traffic police and district officials had listed Vatika Chowk among the 36 accident-prone blackspots, based on an assessment of fatal crashes in areas in Gurgaon. Locals say wrong-side driving is common near the busy intersection that connects SPR and the Sohna Elevated Road (NH-248A). The crash that claimed Neha’s life took place around 400 meters ahead of the Vatika Square on SPR as the pair was going home to Palra village. Both the riders were wearing helmets. Currently, commuters on SPR going towards Badshapur have to take a U-turn that is around 200 metres from Vatika Chowk. This usually translates to a total distance of around 2.4 kilometres. Many commuters, locals allege, drive on the wrong side of the road to get to the intersection and cut their travel time by 10-15 minutes. Traffic cops are actively working to check those violating traffic rules, IO Narender Kumar added. There have been similar accidents in the city in recent months.

Goa police said the vehicle was travelling at such a high speed that when it slammed into the tree, a male passenger was flung out and landed on his head several metres away from the vehicle. The car was being driven by Shawn Fernandes , 26, who died in the accident along with his cousin sister, Abigail D’Souza, 21, and brother-in-law Veldrofe D’Souza, 26. Fiona D’Souza , 22, has suffered serious head injuries and is “battling for life”, while Ninoshka Fernandes, 21, has multiple fractures but is stable, police said. Both are undergoing treatment at GMC. “Prima facie, it appears that the vehicle was overspeeding and while trying to overtake a jeep, the vehicle’s driver lost control. It doesn’t look like alcohol was involved though we cannot say so conclusively,” North Goa SP Nidhin Valsan told TOI. “It seems like Shawn had been working through the day and had only come to pick up the others. He was tired and it appears that he failed to assess the situation correctly,” Valsan said. “Tyre skid marks begin 30 metres before the accident site, and veer from the left side of the road to the right and towards the tree.” Police said the accident occurred on the Panaji-Mapusa highway at around 1.20am, when the car on its way to Parra banged into the tree in front of a stationery store at Porvorim just after Delfino’s supermarket. “The car had five passengers, including the driver. Two of the occupants of the car had gone to Quepem for a birthday party. Shawn had picked them up to bring them to his house at Canca Parra for a celebration,” Porvorim PI Anant Gaonkar said. Shawn’s social media feeds show that he loved cooking and was preparing stuffed chicken and chorizo along with Ninoshka merely hours before his death. Police said it appeared from the fishing rods found near the car that the cousins had planned to go angling on Sunday morning. The postmortem examination of the deceased is yet to be carried out, Valsan said. The high-speed collision stripped the bark of the tree and tore away the rear door of the car. The man who was thrust out of the car appears to have fallen in the middle of the road. Abigail was an Anjuna resident and Veldrofe lived at Badem. Of the survivors, Fiona is a resident of Merces and Ninoshka resides at Anjuna.

Police said the car - a Mahindra TUV - was headed for Rajasthan's Sikar when it crashed into the bus near Crossings Republik around 6am. CCTV footage circulated on social media showed the bus trying to swerve to the right to avoid a collision but ending up crashing into the TUV because the car, too, had steered to its left. TimesView Like speeding, wrong side driving can have disastrous consequences, as exemplified in this case. Those brazenly flouting the rule of the road should receive summary and exemplary punishment. But a long-term solution to the problem lies only in putting an accurate and smart electronic system in place which will ensure that thousands of traffic rule violators — accident or no accident — don’t get away. That will be the best deterrent. The tragic incident also underlines the importance of driving cautiously and being alert all the time on highways. No stopping bus that drove 8km on wrong side The bus (U-CT 7835), being driven on the wrong lane of Delhi-Meerut Expressway, that crashed into an SUV on Tuesday morning, had earlier ferried students of Vishwa Bharti School in Noida but was now attached with a private firm, Orient Fashions. The bus, which still had a sticker of the school pasted on it, is owned by P S Choudhury Tours and Travels, police said. Police identified the dead - all travelling in a Mahindra TUV - as Narendra Yadav (45), who ran an electronics shop in Meerut, his wife Anita, sister-in-law Babita (38), sons Himanshu (12) and Deepanshu (15) and niece Vanshika (7). Narendra's brother, Dharmendra (42), and nephew, Kartik (8), are being treated at a private hospital. The accident triggered questions on the lack of enforcement by traffic cops and patrolling teams of the NHAI on DME. Additional DCP (traffic) Ramanand Kushwaha said the bus driver, Prempal (38) from Aligarh, told police that he filled CNG at a station in Ghazipur. He was going to Nand Nagri in Delhi to pick up employees of the private company, but took a wrong turn. Prempal got on to the DME and kept driving on the wrong side for around 8km until he crashed into the SUV cruising at almost 100kmph. CCTV footage shows the bus entering the DME at Khoda where vehicles are supposed to exit the expressway. ""Such was the impact that the front portion of the car was totally mangled. We had to cut open the windows to get the occupants out. They were taken to SJM Hospital in Noida, where six were declared dead on arrival. Two are undergoing treatment in the emergency ward,"" Kushwaha said. A doctor said Dharmendra and Kartik are in ICU. ""They have grievous injuries in the head and abdomen. The next 48 hours are crucial,"" the doctor said. Sanjay Yadav, Narendra's cousin in Meerut, said the family was headed for a puja at a temple in Sikar. ""The bus travelled for 8km on the wrong side where vehicles zoom at 100kmph. What were the cops doing? There was no NHAI team. What was the fault of my family?"" he asked. A police probe showed the bus had a history of traffic violations. Between 2015 and 2023, it was challaned for Rs 14,000. A complaint was lodged at Wave City police station by Narendra's brother Jitendra. The driver was arrested. The FIR has IPC sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and 427 (mischief causing damage to amount of fifty rupees).

The law mandates that an autorickshaw can ferry only three passengers, but the driver had stuffed up to 10 children, all of them students of a private school in Karunguzhi near Madurantakam, as well as a teacher of the same institution, said police. The driver picked up the children at Chithamangalam and was going along the Chennai-Trichy national highway to their school when a car hit the auto from behind. The vehicle fell into a roadside pit and the 10 children and the driver suffered injuries and were rushed to the nearest government hospital in ambulances. While the children were discharged after treatment, the driver, who suffered grievous injuries, was referred to Chengalpet Government Medical College Hospital for further care. The Madurantakam police, who filed a case, used CCTV cameras to identify the car involved and arrested its driver, Srinivasan, on charges of rash and negligent driving. This has reiterated the need to regulate not only buses and vans, owned by schools, but all private vehicles, including autos and minivans, used to transport schoolchildren, say experts. After the pandemic, most private schools have stopped operating their own buses or vans citing financial reasons. Apart from rising fuel and operational costs, stringent checking norms at RTOs have deterred many schools from continuing van services. This has forced parents to opt for private vans and autos. “They are not subjected to strict checks like school vans and mostly get fitness certificates renewed after paying bribes through agents. This has to change and all vehicles ferrying children should be treated the same way,” said road safety advocate R Srinivasan.

Half an hour later, when she called him again, she was told about the accident. Khan was out on Wednesday midnight to celebrate his 42nd birthday with friends. He had dinner with them and even cut a cake at midnight. TimesView Road safety measures and respect for traffic laws must be inculcated in all schoolchildren from an early age. That a minor could casually drive away with his father’s car and cause the death of someone is part of a larger societal problem. Parents need to counsel their children about the perils of underage driving and taking to the wheel without training. This accident underscores why parents must do this as soon as they bring home a vehicle. The 17-year-old boy, who was driving his father's car, came from Parel with a friend. Khan and his friend, Kiran (35), were returning around 5.30am from Marine Drive. As Khan was taking a right turn, the boy, who was coming at a high speed, applied brakes. ""Since it had rained in the night, the car skidded and it rammed the bike. The impact was so high that the victims were flung into the air and fell on the road. While Khan died on the spot, Kiran was admitted to JJ Hospital, where she died on Wednesday evening. The teenaged driver and his friend did not sustain any injury as the airbags opened when their car hit the bike. ""We have collected his (boy's) blood samples and sent it to the Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina for examination to find out if he was drunk,"" an officer said. The police said the boy, who used to go cycling every morning, took the keys of the car while his father was asleep. He left home saying he was going cycling. He along with a friend came to Chowpatty, where the accident took place, said the police. The boy's father, a bank employee, had bought the car from another person last month and the car is yet to be transferred in his name, said an officer. ""We have submitted a report to the Child Welfare Committee,"" an officer said. The police booked the minor and his father under Section 304A (causing death by negligence), Section 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and Section 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and invoked Section 181 (driving vehicles in contravention of Section 3 or Section 4) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The police recorded the father's statement and issued him a notice. He reportedly told the police that he had undergone a bypass surgery and that is why he could not transfer the car in his name. Relatives were mourning at Khan's residence near Grant Road. ""Khan had two sons, 17 and 15 years old. The elder one wanted to join the IATA course and his father had assured him that he would make all the arrangements for his fees,"" Nishat, Khan's sister in-law, said. Khan was in the scrap business.

The accident happened around 9.30am on Sunday in front of AVL Society in Sector 36. Although the Dwarka Expressway's city section is nearly ready, it is yet to be opened to commuters. But people use the road anyway to avoid making detours when they travel between the new sectors and NH-8 and paying toll at Kherki Daula. On the same expressway lane, as a result, high speed traffic moves in both directions. Tanuj Arya, who drives a cab for a living, was returning to their home in Delhi''s Rohini from Gurgaon with his mother Monika, father Narendra and wife Shikha. They had just taken the expressway when the car on the wrong side crashed into Tanuj's Dzire. ""I could not spot the car because it came all of a sudden. The driver had not switched on the indicators either,"" Tanuj said in his complaint. Monika was in the passenger seat. She suffered injuries in the head and died during treatment at a hospital. The driver of the car on the wrong side and another person with him were injured too. An FIR was registered against the driver at Sector 37 police station under sections 279 (whoever drives any vehicle, or rides, on any public way in a manner so rash or negligent as to endanger human life, or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person), 304A (causing death by negligence), and 337 (whoever causes hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life, or the personal safety of others) of the IPC and Section 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Police said they were checking CCTV footage on the stretch. ""We haven't made any arrests yet. We are scanning CCTV footage to ascertain the sequence of events,"" said Aman, the SHO of Sector 37 police station. Residents living in societies off the expressway warned that more such accidents would happen if NHAI and the traffic police did not take corrective measures immediately to stop wrong-side driving. Three weeks ago, NHAI closed down a loop that allows people to get on to the Dwarka Expressway from NH-8. An alternative - Pataudi Road - is also closed for the past two months. ""So, the only option for people is to pass the Kherki Daula toll plaza and make a long detour. Commuters unwilling to do that resort to wrong-side driving. NHAI and the traffic police must open the loop,"" said Ivan Singh, who lives in Sector 92. ""The loop is ready, but why is NHAI not opening it? It has also not merged the Dwarka Expressway with NH-8 near Narsinghpur. Wrong-side driving is a menace there too,"" said Madan Kumar of Sector 86. NHAI officials told TOI they were trying to expedite ""the remaining work"" so that the expressway could be opened at the earliest. On Monday morning, ACP traffic (west) Akhil Kumar and other cops visited the accident spot along with road safety officers (RSOs) and issued challans to those found driving on the wrong side. ""We will talk to NHAI and ask them to allow traffic on this loop so that people are not forced to pay toll and they do not end up driving on the wrong side too,"" said a senior traffic official.

It appears the driver was overspeeding; there was currently nothing to suggest he was drunk, said cops. The car, a German-make compact SUV, turned into Gurusaday Road from Syed Amir Ali Avenue and was driven around 500 metres, when it spun out of control, swerved sharply to the right and hit the far kerb. A milk truck, coming from the opposite direction, barrelled into its left, making it roll over. The crash alerted several in the neighbourhood, who pulled the SUV's occupants out. The driver, front-seat occupant and a rear-seat passenger were injured, but conscious. The second passenger in the rear seat — Jayantika Jhunjhunwala, (18), of Narkeldanga Main Road — was unconscious. She was declared dead in hospital. Mohan Mishra, a guard who rushed to their help, said three of the SUV's occupants were dazed; the other was unconscious. Senior cops said it looked like the driver — Arnav Chowdhury, 18, a resident of Salt Lake — was speeding. He had a valid driving licence, and was not drunk, it seemed, they said. Arnav suffered fractures, but was not in danger. The two other injured are 17-year-olds Sparsh Makharia and Tanisha Bhatter. They, too, suffered fractures and are not in danger. Arnav and Tanisha are St Xavier's College students; Sparsh studies in an institute in Chennai.
