"AHMEDABAD: No city in Gujarat is immune from stray dog menace. A while ago, Gujarat high court admitted it was getting tough for citizens to go on morning walks because of stray dogs. And, yet, when a stray dog jumped in front of his car, causing him to crash into barricades that led to his wife's death , a 55-year-old from Narmada district blamed himself for it. Paresh Doshi, a teacher, filed an FIR against himself for the accident in Sabarkantha on Sunday afternoon. Doshi and his wife, Amita, were returning from Ambaji temple when the accident occurred near Daan Mahudi village on the Kheroj-Khedbrahma highway. He stated in his FIR that the fatal accident resulted solely from his negligence while driving, as he rammed into barricades to avoid hitting the dog. Doshi told the police, ""My wife and I left our house early on Sunday and reached Ambaji temple around noon. However, the temple was closed. We waited till 1.30pm, offered our prayers and left. I was driving towards Suka Amba village when a stray dog ran in front of our car. I swerved to avoid hitting the canine and lost control of the vehicle, which rammed sideways into makeshift pillars and barricades on the roadside."" ‘Couple got trapped due to auto lock’ One of the barricades pierced through the car’s passenger window and pinned Amita to the seat. “She suffered grievous injuries. Due to the impact, the auto lock mechanism got engaged, trapping us inside,” said Doshi in the FIR.“Bystanders rushed to the rescue. Someone broke the glass on the window, opened the lock and helped us out of the car. Amita was rushed to the hospital, where she was declared dead,” Doshi said. He filed a complaint of causing death by negligence and rash driving against himself.
