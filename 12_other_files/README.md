# ROAD NLP - Real-time Overview and Analysis of Driving Mishaps and Accidents with Natural Language Processing

## Introduction:
In this project, we aim to scrape news data related to car accidents from the Times of India website and process this information to create a structured database containing all the details pertinent to each road accident. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Neural Networks, we will extract, analyze, and organize the news data to develop a comprehensive database that can provide valuable insights into road accidents.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to gather real-time data on car accidents reported by the Times of India and utilize advanced NLP techniques to structure this data into a database format. By doing so, we aim to create a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and organizations working in the field of road safety.

## Methodology:
1. **Data Scraping**: We will utilize web scraping techniques to extract news articles related to car accidents from the Times of India website. Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy will be employed for this purpose. We will focus on articles containing relevant keywords such as "car accident," "road mishap," etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Once the data is scraped, we will preprocess the text data to remove noise, extract relevant information, and standardize the format. This may involve tasks such as text cleaning, tokenization, and stop-word removal.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: NER will be employed to identify and extract entities such as location, date, time, vehicles involved, casualties, etc., from the preprocessed text data. We will utilize pre-trained NER models such as SpaCy or develop custom models based on the requirements of the project.

4. **Database Creation**: The extracted entities will be organized into a structured database format. We will design a schema to store information such as accident location, date and time, vehicles involved (make, model), casualties (injuries, fatalities), weather conditions, and any other relevant details.

5. **Neural Network Models**: Advanced neural network models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer-based architectures like BERT, may be employed for tasks such as sentiment analysis, event prediction, or anomaly detection based on the structured data.

6. **Data Visualization and Analysis**: Finally, we will visualize and analyze the structured data using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau to gain insights into patterns, trends, and correlations related to road accidents.

## Technical Details:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, SpaCy, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Database**: MySQL, SQLite, or MongoDB
- **NLP Techniques**: Tokenization, Stop-word Removal, Lemmatization, Named Entity Recognition
- **Neural Network Architectures**: RNNs, LSTM, BERT
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau

## Conclusion:
By employing a combination of web scraping, NLP, and neural network techniques, we aim to create a robust and structured database of road accident news data. This database will not only serve as a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of road accidents but also facilitate the development of predictive models and preventive measures to enhance road safety.
