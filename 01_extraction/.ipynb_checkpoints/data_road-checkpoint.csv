13,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-seatbelt-worn-during-car-accident-national-body-refuses-relief-to-consumer/articleshow/109382755.cms,"NEW DELHI: The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) has set aside an order of Maharashtra State Consumer Commission which had directed a major car manufacturer to pay Rs 1 lakh compensation for non-deployment of airbags in an accident. The NCDRC arrived at the decision after finding that the driver was not wearing the seatbelt which was one of the reasons for non-deployment of airbags in the crash. Though the NCDRC took note of the consumer’s argument that seatbelt does not need to be used for airbag activation, it observed that his claim lacked supporting evidence. It also turned down the state commission’s finding that manufacturing defects led to the non-deployment of airbags on the same ground. The two-member bench comprising Subhash Chandra and Sadhna Shanker in its order passed on April 4 said, “The issue of seatbelt not being required to be buckled has not been supported by any evidence. The finding of the State Commission that there was a manufacturing defect without the same being established under Section 13(1)(a) which required to be compensated under Section 14 is therefore not based on any finding of fact or legal precedent.” Experts have maintained that airbags in cars work effectively only when seatbelts are fastened. The sections in the order referred to the provisions of Consumer Protection Act. As per the NCDRC order, one Mumbai-based Ushat Gulgule had bought a Honda Civic from a dealer in Pune. The car met with an accident in March 2013 on the Western Express Highway and its front portion got damaged. Gulgule also received serious injuries. The car owner filed a case in the Maharashtra state commission alleging that the car failed to deploy airbags despite severe impact attributing this to a manufacturing defect. Honda informed the consumer that airbags deploy when specific conditions are met and it informed the state commission that the consumer had not buckled the seatbelt, which was also a reason for non-deployment of airbags. The state commission had concluded that the airbags should have opened as a safety feature despite not wearing of seatbelt since the impact of crash was very forceful. It had also taken note of media reports of the carmaker recalling vehicles due to defect in airbags. The commission had ordered Rs 1 lakh compensation to Gulgule. When the matter was heard by NCDCRC, the consumer had cited the report of Western India Automobile Association that the airbags ought to have opened given the nature of accident and also referred to media reports of the carmker recalling two lakh Honda Civic between 2013 and 2015 due to problems in airbags. In its order the NCDRC concluded that the report of the automobile association can’t be relied upon as an “expert opinion” since it’s neither an “appropriate laboratory” as per the Consumer Protection Act nor does it provide any assessment of the non-deployment of airbags. “In the absence of there being any technical or expert opinion as required under Section 13(1)(c), the finding of the State Commission of a defect in the car is not sustainable,” the NCDRC bench said.","Updated: Apr 18, 2024, 07:29 IST"
